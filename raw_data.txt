So when an iPhone user visits that particular website, the website automatically implants malicious software into target&#8217;s iPhone. This malicious software can collect sensitive data like images &amp; contacts.<\/p>\n<p>Searchers also said that the website attracted pretty much thousands of visitors per week.

This includes five affected kernels and two separate sandbox escapes.<\/p>\n<p>Once the hacker launches the implant on the victim&#8217;s iPhone, he\/she can gather and transfer information like images, data, GPS location and contacts to an external server which transmits the data every 60 seconds ie 1 minute. This also puts the user&#8217;s device at risk since this also includes passwords in &#8220;data&#8221; as we say. Or who knows what more can be affected? Because there are people who forget their bank passwords so to avoid it, they mostly store it in their notepad apps on their iPhones, which too can be exposed to the hackers.<\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"How_Is_Apple_Responding_To_Google%E2%80%99s_Disclosure\"><\/span>How Is Apple Responding To Google&#8217;s Disclosure?<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>The post says that the vulnerability was disclosed on 1st February 2019 and the company gave 7-day deadline to Cupertino(Apple Headquarters).

This is where he says that the data breach was very limited.<\/p>\n<p>But by the report of TheHackerNews, the users&#8217; data were directly accessible. For example, if you call their search engine number &#8216;88888-88888&#8217;, they will help you and collect your details. After then, your details are stored in their database. TheHackerNews provided the researcher with a fresh number which was never used to contact JustDial.<\/p>\n<p>When TheHackerNews contacted JustDial over their customer helpline, they shared random details. Just after the call was completed, Rajshekhar provided him with all the details he provided to helpline agent.

These API can trigger false OTPs to a particular phone number in the name of JustDial. This cannot be called a vulnerability but can cost the company a lot. This can also put the company&#8217;s reputation at risk as this bug can be used to spam.

How Does It Work? Detailed Explanation<\/a><\/p>\n<h1><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"How_To_Bypass_Cloudflare\"><\/span><strong>How To Bypass Cloudflare<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h1>\n<p>There isn&#8217;t just one step the bypass cloudflare. If not configured properly after setup, the website is vulnerable to get bypassed. Let&#8217;s see what are the steps through which we can bypass Cloudflare.<\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Pinging_SubDomains\"><\/span><strong>Pinging SubDomains<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Yes. When someone adds their website to Cloudflare, cloudflare automatically scans over all sub-domains on the domain and shows the list. However, only few of them which are set as default has the cloudflare protection enabled. If other sub-domains are pinged, they might show the server IP of the website&#8217;s origin.<\/p>\n<p><img data-attachment-id=\"523\" data-permalink=\"https:\/\/theshadowpress.com\/how-to-bypass-cloudflare\/pingingsubdomain\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/theshadowpress.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/pingingsubdomain.png\" data-orig-size=\"640,402\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"pingingsubdomain\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/theshadowpress.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/pingingsubdomain-300x188.png\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/theshadowpress.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/pingingsubdomain.png\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-523\" src=\"https:\/\/theshadowpress.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/pingingsubdomain-300x188.png\" alt=\"Pinging Sub Domains\" width=\"600\" height=\"376\" srcset=\"https:\/\/theshadowpress.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/pingingsubdomain-300x188.png 300w, https:\/\/theshadowpress.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/pingingsubdomain.png 640w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>For example, the website with domain example.com is protected with Cloudflare. But it isn&#8217;t configured properly or has been left on default settings, the sub-domains might still be vulnerable to expose the real IP. Maybe &#8220;mail.example.com&#8221; or &#8220;server.example.com&#8221; would still be showing the real IP? Try pinging them all until you find the IP which isn&#8217;t hosted on Cloudflare&#8217;s network.<\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"How_can_we_find_that_the_IP_isn%E2%80%99t_hosted_on_Cloudflare\"><\/span><strong>How can we find that the IP isn&#8217;t hosted on Cloudflare?<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>By simply tracking it. Cloudflare&#8217;s IP addresses are mostly hosted on their US servers and can be detected easily. Not necessarily USA, they&#8217;ve got many datacenters. You can simply check their ISP. If it is Cloudflare, it will show &#8220;Cloudflare&#8221;, if it doesn&#8217;t show &#8220;Cloudflare&#8221;, it is the real IP. Note that, not every non-cloudflare hosted IP(s) are website&#8217;s origin. Some might be their another server IP or maybe their 3rd party mail server&#8217;s provider IP, so be specific and use your common sense during the operation.<\/p>\n<h4><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"How_can_we_track_it\"><\/span><strong>How can we track it?<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h4>\n<p>Tracking might sound a big deal. But actually it is not. Yes, it is hard to find accurate location of the IP address, but still you can use public IP trackers. The best and most accurate(not exact) available for free is <a href=\"https:\/\/shadowcrypt.club\/ip\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ShadowCrypt<\/a>. Just enter the IP address and press &#8220;Submit&#8221; and the results are is raw format!<\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Finding_Out_Domain%E2%80%99s_IP\/Nameserver_History\"><\/span><strong>Finding Out Domain&#8217;s IP\/Nameserver History<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>If you manage to find out domain&#8217;s IP address or it&#8217;s name server history, then you might have a chance to assume the real IP. Most of website owners migrate their website and then add Cloudflare. IP History archives keeps the record of which domain has changed to which IP and when. Like your target website was once hosted on Digital Ocean, but then was added to Cloudflare. How can you find that specific IP address of Digital Ocean? You can lookout for it&#8217;s history.<\/p>\n<p>You can use <a href=\"https:\/\/viewdns.info\/iphistory\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">ViewDNS<\/a>. They provide a record of &#8220;most&#8221; of domain&#8217;s IP history. Not all domains, but atleast more then half of your query.<\/p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s take a scenario of finding out IP address of the website &#8220;Tech2Hack.com&#8221;. It is currently under Cloudflare but I know it was hosted on NameCheap once. But which IP? I&#8217;ll find it by checking it&#8217;s IP history.<\/p>\n<p><img data-attachment-id=\"524\" data-permalink=\"https:\/\/theshadowpress.com\/how-to-bypass-cloudflare\/iphistorytech2hackcom\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/theshadowpress.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/iphistorytech2hackcom.png\" data-orig-size=\"997,489\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"iphistorytech2hackcom\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/theshadowpress.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/iphistorytech2hackcom-300x147.png\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/theshadowpress.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/iphistorytech2hackcom.png\" class=\" wp-image-524 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/theshadowpress.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/iphistorytech2hackcom-300x147.png\" alt=\"IP History of Tech2Hack.com\" width=\"616\" height=\"302\" srcset=\"https:\/\/theshadowpress.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/iphistorytech2hackcom-300x147.png 300w, https:\/\/theshadowpress.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/iphistorytech2hackcom-768x377.png 768w, https:\/\/theshadowpress.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/iphistorytech2hackcom-324x160.png 324w, https:\/\/theshadowpress.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/iphistorytech2hackcom-533x261.png 533w, https:\/\/theshadowpress.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/iphistorytech2hackcom-696x341.png 696w, https:\/\/theshadowpress.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/iphistorytech2hackcom-856x420.png 856w, https:\/\/theshadowpress.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/iphistorytech2hackcom.png 997w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 616px) 100vw, 616px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>You can see the past 4 IP address records made by ViewDNS are from Cloudflare.

The reason behind this is that the website is hosted on a shared hosting. And Of course, Namecheap provides shared hosting in a very affordable price too! So there might be many websites hosted on the same server. This makes the hosting provider unable to provide dedicated IP so they host them all on a single server. Mostly when a private server is used, the server&#8217;s directory is &#8220;\/var\/www\/html&#8221; but when a shared one is used, it is usually &#8220;\/home\/websiteusername\/public_html&#8221; where &#8220;websiteusername&#8221; defines the cPanel username of the website&#8217;s owner hosting account. There are many users hosted in the same server like &#8220;websiteuser2&#8221; and &#8220;websiteuser3&#8221; or &#8220;randomusername&#8221; or &#8220;websiteownername&#8221;. It depends on the website&#8217;s owner or sometimes hosting provider to assign the username. The website is hosted on same IP you&#8217;ve found.<\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Using_A_3rd_Party_Cloudflare_Resolver\"><\/span>Using A 3rd Party Cloudflare Resolver<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>You can use a 3rd party cloudflare resolver.

However it is still proven to be working against several weak websites.<\/p>\n<p>BlackProject can take down websites having PHP pages. The script sends malicious HTTP requests over PHP and hence, making it slow down. As soon as the PHP script takes more then it&#8217;s configured max_exec time in php.ini, the website goes down with an error &#8220;Gateway Error&#8221; or &#8220;503 Timed Out&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>Earlier in 2016, the tool was proven to be effective against most of websites including few government websites according to <a href=\"https:\/\/theshadowpress.com\/hackers-group-cobra-command-claims-to-have-taken-down-flipkart\/\">Cobra Command.<\/a><\/p>\n<p>But for now, the tool can be used for personal pentesting. As per ShadowCrypt&#8217;s test against several WordPress websites, the BlackProject still works and can take down fewer PHP based websites.<\/p>\n<h1><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"How_To_Protect_An_Average_Website_Against_BlackProject%E2%80%99s_Attack\"><\/span><strong>How To Protect An Average Website Against BlackProject&#8217;s Attack?<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h1>\n<p>As already mentioned above, the script tries to overload website&#8217;s resources through the mean of php. Hence, the website can be protected by increasing the value upto two times in php.ini settings. As per ShadowCrypt&#8217;s instructions, website owners can either add Cloudflare&#8217;s protection for the first 2-3 days so that Cloudflare&#8217;s algorithm checks up all possible IPs and block the attack. Or, it is recommended for the website owners to change(double) the values of the\u00a0post_max_size,\u00a0memory_limit,max_input_time and\u00a0max_execution_time. This method has been personally tried and proven to be working.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<h1><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"TheBlackProject\"><\/span>TheBlackProject<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h1>\n<p>TheBlackProject is a HTTP Layer 7 DoS script which is an upgraded version of GoldenEye.

John&#8217;s full name is John Deo and his date of birth if 12th October 1980. John uses his password as 12101980 for Facebook logins and 121080 for Mobile PIN for his banking app access. John uses the password\u00a012101980 which is same as Facebook&#8217;s login into the malicious app and registers over there. The hacker now reads and predicts all the possible password ranges and tries every possible passwords and get access!

If your coding have vulnerabilities within it, you&#8217;re gone. The main work of an hacker to breach into the server is to check for core vulnerability. Before hiring a web developer or a programmer for your project, make sure you write up and let him sign the agreement for the responsibility of your network. You can add <a href=\"https:\/\/sucuri.net\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Sucuri WAF<\/a>(Web App Firewall) to make sure if there is any vulnerability in your website, hacker cannot exploit it. They&#8217;re good enough, so I&#8217;d recommend you.<\/p>\n<p>A few weeks back, Kodi, an online movie streaming application&#8217;s addon was found to be compromised by an attacker.

Let&#8217;s see what our beloved Wikipedia has got to say about Firewall.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>In computing, a firewall is a network security system that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules. A firewall typically establishes a barrier between a trusted internal network and untrusted external network, such as the Internet.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>If you&#8217;re at corporate level and have 5000$+ budget to spend on security, I would recommend you to buy <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cloudflare.com\/\">Cloudflare&#8217;s<\/a> Enterprise plan.

It had features like bundling emails, and awesome AI features like\u00a0Smart Reply, Nudges and high-priority notifications.<\/p>\n<p>This sudden announcement isn&#8217;t a great surprise yet. Google has already added many Inbox features to Gmail. Also, the long interval or no upd8ate has already indicated about the closure of Google Inbox earlier.<\/p>\n<p>Still Google hasn&#8217;t added enough features in it&#8217;s Gmail platform. Although Google hasn&#8217;t yet added exciting features yet, there is still 7 months left for Google to make changes. It is more then enough for tech-giants like Google to make dozens of remarkable features. Still, It is great to see that Google is focusing on a single e-mail platform. It makes it more relevant for a giant to be focused on one.<\/p>\n<p>This brings in a lot of possible improvements\u00a0in the Gmail. Like we might see some AI features in the future.

Many times the local IP address assigned to you has a speed limitation which may cause unnecessary speeding limits to your device. Most of time, this is happened when someone sets up speed limit on the router for you. This locks down the Internet speed at specified ingress and\u00a0Egress bandwidth which limits your incoming and outgoing packet transfer. To do release the specified IP address, type the following command in the black window(command prompt) and press enter.<\/p>\n<pre>ipconfig \/renew<\/pre>\n<p>Your IP address would be released. Wait there! Many times we face downtime after we perform this command in our command prompt. If you face one, you can simple goto &#8220;Start &gt; Run &gt; Type &#8220;NCPA.cpl&#8221; and select your network adapter &gt; Right click on it and &#8220;troubleshoot&#8221; button.&#8221; This will troubleshoot your connectivity issue and get you connected back to Internet with another local IP address assigned to your PC\/Laptop.<\/p>\n<h1><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Flushing_The_DNS\"><\/span><strong>Flushing The DNS<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h1>\n<p>Whenever you visit a website with default DNS, your PC caches the website&#8217;s IP address to improve it&#8217;s load time for the next time.

But if there is a major change in the website you&#8217;re visiting, you may often encounter yourself to be visiting the old version of the website which is mostly slow. This leads to slow browsing experience to that particular website. Sometimes even after flushing the DNS cache, you face the issue because your DNS server isn&#8217;t informed about the change yet. This happens when you&#8217;re running on a slower DNS server. Let&#8217;s go on with the step to change DNS server IP address to experience faster browsing experience.<\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Steps\"><\/span>Steps<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>To do the above action, press &#8220;Windows key + R&#8221; to open run window.

For just 2.9$(206 INR), you can get your single computer secured. For the first, it took 4-5 hours to scan my PC. I restarted my PC and found it to be more lagging for the first 2 restarts.

It&#8217;s quite costly then compared to Kaspersky but it worth the price. I had this antivirus in my PC back in year 2016 and it was running quite good. Looking down to the review, it can still hold a good reputation in my eyes. Just the matter is of price, else it&#8217;s better then any other antivirus! The feature they&#8217;ve provided worth the price. Even after being worth of it&#8217;s price, it still holds the 2nd position because this is based within India.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.indiaantivirus.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Net Protector Antivirus<\/a><\/p>\n<h1><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"3_QuickHeal_Antivirus\"><\/span>3. <strong>QuickHeal Antivirus<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h1>\n<p><img data-attachment-id=\"344\" data-permalink=\"https:\/\/theshadowpress.com\/top-4-antivirus\/quickheal\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/theshadowpress.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/09\/quickheal.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"640,400\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"quickheal\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/theshadowpress.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/09\/quickheal-300x188.jpg\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/theshadowpress.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/09\/quickheal.jpg\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-344\" src=\"https:\/\/theshadowpress.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/09\/quickheal-300x188.jpg\" alt=\"Quickheal\" width=\"320\" height=\"201\" srcset=\"https:\/\/theshadowpress.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/09\/quickheal-300x188.jpg 300w, https:\/\/theshadowpress.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/09\/quickheal.jpg 640w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>QuickHeal secures it&#8217;s 3rd position in our list because of it&#8217;s UI and relevancy.

If we talk about relevancy, it doesn&#8217;t suits up our need. Well, not actually but it isn&#8217;t good for PC with ram lower then 4 GB. It is good for high-performance and gaming PC but not for low-end PC for official use. Although if we talk about high end performance about this antivirus, it is good enough to optimize game-plays. We&#8217;ll give them 3.5 out of five stars.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.bitdefender.com\/\">Bitdefender Antivirus Plus<\/a><\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p>The above antivirus holds for the top 4 antivirus because of their relevancy, pricing and UI. The above reviews are based on personal and public review experienced by us or other users. ShortBytes is not sponsored by any of the antivirus in any form hence it is just for review purpose. You may choose antivirus depending on your need. For me, I am currently using Kaspersky and I recommend you too if you want to boost your PC performance. Thank you for reading.

FreeVPS has been providing VPS through their sponsors from last eight years without any discontinuation.<\/p>\n<p>But because of recent announcement about FreeVPS.us closure, it has become difficult for their existing user to find another Free VPS community.

Since then, however, VPSs have decreased in popularity as cloud-based solutions like Amazon&#8217;s AWS and easy website tools like Squarespace and Wix have taken their place. We&#8217;ve seen the result on our forum as well: we&#8217;ve lost sponsors, activity is down, and fewer new members sign up.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Here is the timeline posted by Ignis, the administrator of the community.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Immediately: End of VPS Giveaways.

It is a &#8220;virtual&#8221; part of a dedicated box situated somewhere around the globe. The location of the VPS depends on the location of the dedicated box. In simple words, we can say it as virtual computer. To rent a VPS, the consumer must pay few dollars per month to keep it running. FreeVPS.us was doing the same by providing the VPS from the dedicated box provided by their sponsors. Startups, gameservers, websites and other online community using their service have been shocked because of the FreeVPS.us closure.<\/p>\n<p>I salute to the whole FreeVPS.us staff and thank them for providing FreeVPS.us to the one who needed it.<\/p>\n<p>Other free VPS communities like FreeVPS.club has too started showing decline in activity. The main cause of closure of Free VPS communities are lack of sponsors and decline in activity. Most of the users that joins the community are more likely present just for VPS and once they get it, they just abandon the community for the month. At the end of the month, they come back and post few times. Earning the post to keep their vps and abandon them back.<\/p>\n<h1>How does Free VPS community works?<\/h1>\n<p>To get a free vps from the community, users must show some activity within their forums by earning a small amount of post. Once the user passes the threshold, he\/she can post a request for FreeVPS and it will be accepted by the staffs if the user meets the requirements. Sponsors *were* more likely to sponsor Free VPS communities because earning posts increases the activity of the community and the higher the activity is the more visibility on the Google is possible. To get backlinks, sponsors usually gives a small part of their container to communities in exchange of backlinks.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>On 1st May 2018, the community administrator of FreeVPS.us has posted in an announcement about the permanent closure of the FreeVPS.us community.

So let&#8217;s begin with our own conception of the Social Engineering.<\/p>\n<h1>Social Engineering Introduction<\/h1>\n<p>Social Engineering is a method by which an attacker\/hacker influences his\/her victim in order of get his\/her details or making them do something we want them to do.<\/p>\n<p><img data-attachment-id=\"261\" data-permalink=\"https:\/\/theshadowpress.com\/social-engineering-introduction\/meme-justin\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/theshadowpress.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/meme-justin.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"480,601\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"meme justin\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/theshadowpress.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/meme-justin-240x300.jpg\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/theshadowpress.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/meme-justin.jpg\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-261\" src=\"https:\/\/theshadowpress.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/meme-justin-240x300.jpg\" alt=\"Scary Grandpa hacking into her ex girlfriend's account.\" width=\"339\" height=\"423\" srcset=\"https:\/\/theshadowpress.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/meme-justin-240x300.jpg 240w, https:\/\/theshadowpress.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/meme-justin.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 339px) 100vw, 339px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Yea, the meme above is a simple definition of Social Engineering. So when we are online on Internet, try not to make it your home because it can be more harmful then you think.<\/p>\n<p>Sometimes peoples get too emotional with their thoughts that they post their grievance on social media. Moreover, the reason for posting is the need of attention. After reading the post, the attacker may reach to you and be a shoulder to cry on. But wait! It&#8217;s not true. He may have came to you to collect your details. Let&#8217;s take an example that you&#8217;ve gone through breakup, he&#8217;ll come to you and be a good listener and will eventually get your details.<\/p>\n<p>Yes, that&#8217;s scary. Yea, for me too. I have gone through this phase. Well, how far can this be dangerous? More then you think! Ofc. You may tell your girlfriend&#8217;s name or your ex&#8217;s name to him frankly but he&#8217;ll use it to brute your FB account. Look! How scary it is.<\/p>\n<p>Well, that&#8217;s all for Introduction part. I&#8217;ll be coming in with next article sooner about what types of details can be captured over Internet by the method of Social Engineering. Thank you for reading and have a great day ahead!

One must keep their password that are strong enough so that whenever there is a breach, hacker cannot decrypt your password.<\/p>\n<h1>Choosing Secured Passwords<\/h1>\n<p>Choosing strong and secured passwords always doesn&#8217;t mean that it should contain special symbols, letters and alphabets. The password you choose matters, not the character present. So next time, make sure you choose a strong password considering the quality of it.<\/p>\n<p>An average password must contain atleast a letter,a capital letter alphabet, a special symbol like &#8216;@&#8217;, a number and so on.<\/p>\n<p>But when a hacker tries to decrypt a password, he does it from billions of password combinations. So, choose a password that doesn&#8217;t contain &#8216;a word&#8217;, I mean, a dictionary work.<\/p>\n<h1>Choosing Really Strong Password<\/h1>\n<p>In above paragraph, we can see the average password combinations. But now to choose a &#8216;really&#8217; strong password is a great deal. I mean, it is not a big deal but it&#8217;s easy to use.<\/p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s take a sentence, maybe a sentence from a movie? Let&#8217;s take this sentence.<\/p>\n<p>&#8216;I love Nissan Skyline Very Much Which Cost 1$&#8217;<\/p>\n<p>Now this sentence looks crazy, but it covers all the basic combinations we need. But we cannot use this as a password so let&#8217;s take the first letter of every word beginning. We&#8217;ll use the above given sentence.<\/p>\n<p>Ilnsvmwc1$<\/p>\n<p>Now, this looks nice, doesn&#8217;t it? The &#8216;I&#8217; stands for &#8216;I&#8217; as a capital alphabet, &#8216;l&#8217; stands for &#8216;love&#8217;, &#8216;ns&#8217; stands for Nissan Skyline, &#8216;vm&#8217; stands for &#8216;very much&#8217;, &#8216;w&#8217; stands for which and &#8216;c1$&#8217; stands for &#8216;costs 1$&#8217;.<\/p>\n<p>This isn&#8217;t a dictionary word, nor a simple sentence. You cannot find this password anywhere else. You can use any sentence in your mind. For example<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>I love Honda City 2007 Model @ pricing of 27,000 INR = Ilhc2007m@po27000INR<\/li>\n<li>My hobby is to do computer hacking and that gets me paid for 2$. = Mhitdchatgmpf2$<\/li>\n<li>There is an appointment for me @ 7 PM. = Tiaafm@7PM<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Above are some sentences that contains all the combinations we need for a &#8216;basic&#8217; password.<\/p>\n<p><em>Note :- This article may gets further update and subscribers will get updated about it.<\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Nowadays, Passwords are considered to be the most confidential data of someone&#8217;s digital life.

So, Always keep your computer protected by choosing best combinations of passwords. When a hacker gains access to a website, the data is stored into the database of the website. Except passwords, all the data are in plain texts. Passwords are kept in salt. So, if you have a strong password, then it will be hard for the hacker to decrypt the password. So, next time you putup password in your computer, include special character in the passwords like, &#8216;@!#$%^&#8217; with atleast one character in capital letter and atleast in small and one in numbers.<\/p>\n<h1><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Arm_your_computer_by_making_it_to_wear_vest\"><\/span>Arm your computer by making it to wear vest.<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h1>\n<p>VPN, stands for Virtual Private Network.

It has been a threat for big organizations and companies because in today&#8217;s generation many organizations put up competition against other companies that are making progress then their own&#8217;s. They hire hackers and make them take down their competitors. Not only for competitors, but there are many other reasons why a hacker may take down servers or websites. Like rivalry,paid tasks,just for fun and etc.<\/p>\n<p>Denial of services occurs when a targeted computer\/server is flooded with malicious traffic until the resources are exhausted and the system goes offline. Distributed Denial of Services are much similar with Denial Of Services but the difference is the DDoS i.e Distributed Denial of Service the attack is amplified by enlisting other machines\/servers in the attack to take down the target. Most of large-scale attacks depends on <a href=\"http:\/\/shortbytes.net\/what-is-botnet-and-how-does-it-works\/\">botnets<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Common_types_of_DDoS_attacks_used_by_hackers\"><\/span>Common types of DDoS attacks used by hackers.<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<h4><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"UDP_Flood\"><\/span>UDP Flood<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h4>\n<p>User Datagram Protocol that is UDP is a sessionless connection to a network. It is one of the most common type of DDoS attack that can be used in same DoS and DDoS attacks. Random ports are flooded on the target machine and that results the machine to go down.<\/p>\n<h4><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"SYN_Flood\"><\/span>SYN Flood<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h4>\n<p>A &#8220;three type of handshake&#8221;, which is a reference to show how TCP connections work. The SYN-ACK communication type works in three steps and those steps are as follows:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Firstly a &#8220;synchronize&#8221; message is sent to the target machine to start the conversation with the machine.<\/li>\n<li>Secondly, the connection is &#8220;acknowledged&#8221; by the host machine i.e the target machine. After this process, it sends a &#8220;handshake&#8221; request and waits for the host machine to close the connection.<\/li>\n<li>Now if the machine accepts the request of the handshake, it closes down the connection.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>A SYN flood attack will send repeated spoofed request to the machine from many sources and instead of the machine to go offline, it timesout. Eventually, when a strong attack is sent i.e many sources are involved in it, the server have higher chances to go offline.<\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Ping_of_Death\"><\/span>Ping of Death<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Ping of Death that is also called as &#8220;POD&#8221; is Denial of Service that manipulates IP sending larger packet then minimum allowance under IPv6 that is 65535 bytes. Larger packets are divided across multiple IPs but when they are reassembled, they become a strong one and that is what we call it as &#8220;fragment&#8221; attack that is also known as &#8220;FRAG&#8221; in many booter services.<\/p>\n<p>Note:POD isn&#8217;t affective nowadays because the firewall that are installed in routers now block the &#8220;ICMP&#8221; packets that comes in flood.<\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Reflected_Attacks\"><\/span>Reflected Attacks<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>A reflection attack is where an attacker sends forged packets from many different sources. The target machine accepts and replies the attacking machine but as we already mentioned, the attack is made up from many different sources and when the target machine are overloaded by replying the packets from attacking machine, it closes down or goes offline.<\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Slowloris\"><\/span>Slowloris<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Slowloris is the one of the most powerful attack that are very difficult to mitigate. Slowloris is a tool used by the attacker which uses fewer resources. During this attack, the Slowloris opens a partial connection with the target and stay online for as much time as possible. It also sends HTTP headers when the connection is established. This HTTP request is added in the connection. The session lasts long until the server&#8217;s resources are exhausted and the system goes offline.<\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Application_Based_Attacks\"><\/span>Application Based Attacks<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Application based attacks are the attack that is used by the attacker to target a specific application installed on the server. Rather then taking down whole of the server, it exploits the\u00a0vulnerability and takes down the application. The most of applications that are targeted by this attack are WordPress, MyBB, Joomla and other CMS and web forum applications.<\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;ve written down all the basic types of DDoS attacks that occurs nowadays.

How does it works?"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>DNS Amplification is a reflection based distributed denial of service attack.<\/p>\n<p>The attacker spoofs look-up requests to domain name system (DNS) servers to hide the source of the exploit and direct the response to the target. Through various techniques, the attacker turns a small DNS query into a much larger payload directed at the target network.<\/p>\n<p>The attacker sends a DNS look-up request using the spoofed IP address of the target to vulnerable DNS servers. Most commonly, these are DNS servers that support open recursive relay. The original request is often relayed through a botnet for a larger base of attack and further concealment. The DNS request is sent using the EDNS0 extension to the DNS protocol allowing for large DNS messages. It may also use the DNS security extension (DNSSEC) cryptographic feature to add to the size of the message.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What is reflection based attack?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>In computer security, a\u00a0<b>reflection attack<\/b>\u00a0is a method of attacking a challenge-response authentication system that uses the same protocol in both directions. That is, the same challenge-response protocol is used by each side to authenticate the other side.<\/p>\n<p>DNS Amplification Attacks are a way for an attacker to magnify the amount of bandwidth they can target at a potential victim. Imagine you are an attacker and you control a botnet capable of sending out 100Mbps of traffic. While that may be sufficient to knock some sites offline, it is a relatively trivial amount of traffic in the world of DDoS. In order to increase your attack&#8217;s volume, you could try and add more compromised machines to your botnet. That is becoming increasingly difficult. Alternatively, you could find a way to amplify your 100Mbps into something much bigger.<\/p>\n<h2>MITIGATION<\/h2>\n<p>Unfortunately, due to the massive traffic volume that can be produced by one of these attacks, there is often little that the victim can do to counter a large-scale DNS amplification-based distributed denial-of-service attack. However, it is possible to reduce the number of servers that can be used by attackers to generate the traffic volumes.<\/p>\n<p>While the only effective means of eliminating the use of recursive resolvers in this type of attack is to eliminate unsecured recursive resolvers, this requires an extensive effort by various parties. According to the Open DNS Resolver Project, of the 27 million known DNS resolvers on the Internet, approximately \u201c25 million pose a significant threat\u201d of being used in an attack [1]. However, several possible techniques are available to reduce the overall effectiveness of such attacks to the Internet community as a whole. Where possible, configuration links have been provided to assist administrators with making the recommended changes. The configuration information has been limited to BIND9 and Microsoft\u2019s DNS Server, which are two widely deployed DNS servers on federal networks. If you are running a different DNS server, please consult your vendor\u2019s documentation for configuration details.<\/p>\n<p>If you found out our article to be useful then please leave a feedback in comment!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>DNS Amplification is a reflection based distributed denial of service attack.

we all know, this is the type of malware that has become highly popular and is one of the most widely discussed topic in the field of computer security. A virus is just a computer program that is designed to take\u00a0unauthorized control of the infected computer so as to cause harm to the system\u2019s data or degrade its performance.<\/p>\n<h4><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Mode_of_operation\"><\/span>Mode of operation:<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h4>\n<p>Computer viruses operates by attaching themselves to an already\u00a0existing file or program and replicates itself to spread from one computer to another. In most cases, they tend to infect executable files that are parts of legitimate programs. So, whenever the infected file is executed on a new computer, the virus gets activated and begins to operate by further replication or causing the intended damage to the system.<\/p>\n<p>A virus cannot perform its task of harming and replication\u00a0unless it is allowed to execute. This is the reason why viruses often choose an executable file as its host and get attached to them. Viruses are mainly classified into two types:<\/p>\n<p><strong>Non-Resident Viruses:<\/strong>\u00a0This kind of virus will execute along with its host, perform the needful action of finding and infecting the other possible files and eventually transfers the control back to the main program (host). The operation of the virus will terminate along with that of its host.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Resident Viruses:<\/strong>\u00a0In case of resident viruses, whenever the infected program is run by the user, the virus gets activated, loads its replication module into the memory and then transfers the control back to the main program. In this case, the virus still remains active in the memory waiting for an opportunity to find and infect other files even after the main program (host) has been terminated.<\/p>\n<h4><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Damages_caused\"><\/span>Damages caused:<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h4>\n<p>Viruses are known to cause destruction of data and software programs.\u00a0In some cases, a virus may do nothing other than just replicating itself. However, they are responsible for using a large portion of the system\u00a0resources\u00a0such as CPU and memory which results in the performance degradation of the computer.<\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Trojan_horse\"><\/span>Trojan horse:<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>A Trojan horse or simply called as Trojan is a type of malicious program that disguises itself as something that is legitimate or useful. The main purpose of a trojan is to gain the trust of the user from the front end, so that it gets the permission to be installed. But, from the back end, it is designed to grant unauthorized control of the computer to the hacker.<\/p>\n<h4><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Mode_of_operation-2\"><\/span>Mode of operation:<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h4>\n<p>A Trojan horse do not depend on the host to carry out its operation. So, unlike a computer virus,\u00a0it does not tend to attach itself to other files. Trojans are often disguised as video codecs, software cracks, keygens and other similar programs downloaded from untrusted sources. So, one has to be careful about those untrusted websites that offer free downloads.<\/p>\n<p>One of the most popular example is the\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/DNSChanger\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>DNSChanger<\/strong><\/a>\u00a0trojan that was designed to hijack the DNS servers of the victimized computers. It was distributed by some of the rogue pornographic websites as a video codec needed to view online content.<\/p>\n<h4><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Damages_caused-2\"><\/span>Damages caused:<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h4>\n<p>Trojan horses are known to cause a wide variety of damages such as stealing passwords and login details, electronic money theft, logging keystrokes, modify\/delete files, monitor user activity etc.<\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Worms\"><\/span>Worms:<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Worms are standalone computer programs with a malicious intent that spread from one computer to another. Unlike viruses, worms have the ability to operate independently and hence do not attach themselves to another program.<\/p>\n<h4><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Mode_of_operation-3\"><\/span>Mode of operation:<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h4>\n<p>Worms often use a computer network to spread itself by exploiting the security vulnerabilities that exist inside the individual computers. In most cases, worms are designed only to spread without causing any serious change to the computer system.<\/p>\n<h4><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Damage_caused\"><\/span>Damage caused:<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h4>\n<p>Unlike viruses, worms do not cause damage to the system files and other important programs. However, they are responsible for consuming the bandwidth thereby degrading the performance of the network.<\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Spyware\"><\/span>Spyware:<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Spyware is a type of malicious software that can collect information about the activities of the target computer without the knowledge of its users. Spywares such as keyloggers are often installed by the owner or administrator\u00a0of the computer in order to monitor the activities of the users. This can be a parent trying to monitor his child, a company owner trying to monitor his employee or someone trying to spy on his\/her spouse.<\/p>\n<h4><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Mode_of_operation-4\"><\/span>Mode of operation:<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h4>\n<p>Spywares are designed to operate in a totally stealth mode so that its presence is completely hidden from the users of the computer. Once installed, they silently monitor all the activities on the computer such as keystrokes, web activity, IM logs etc. These logs are stored secretly for later access or uploaded online so that the installer of the spyware program can have access to them.<\/p>\n<h4><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Damage_caused-2\"><\/span>Damage caused:<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h4>\n<p>Apart from monitoring, spywares do not cause any damage to the computer. However, in some cases the affected computer may experience degradation in its performance.<\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Adware\"><\/span>Adware:<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Adware is a software program that automatically renders\u00a0advertisements\u00a0to the users without their consent. Most common examples are pop-ups, pop-unders and other annoying banner ads. The prime reason behind the design of adware is to generate revenue for its author.<\/p>\n<h4><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Mode_of_operation-5\"><\/span>Mode of operation:<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h4>\n<p>Adwares are often bundled up with some of the free utilities such as a browser toolbars, video downloaders etc. When such programs are installed, the adware may take over and distract user activity by displaying annoying advertisements.<\/p>\n<h4><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Damage_caused-3\"><\/span>Damage caused:<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h4>\n<p>Adware is harmless in most of the occasions. However, some\u00a0are known to contain spywares that are used to monitor the surfing habits of users. This may pose a threat to the privacy of the users.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Malware is a collective term used to represent virus, worms, spyware and other malicious programs out there on the Internet.

As mentioned above, Botnet is a network of \u201chacked\u201d computers\/servers that are used to execute Distributed Denial of Server(DDoS attack), steal data, send spam mails\/viruses and etc. Botnet is controlled by a single individual who have access to all of his bots that have been under controlled by the virus the victim have downloaded. When a Internet user are being baited to download hack tools like \u201cCOC Hack tool latest 2017\u2033,\u201dFacebook Hack tool 100% working for all Windows.\u201d, and etc, all those hack tools are fake and 75% of files are infected by viruses which helps the attacker to gain access to your PC without the permission of the user.<\/p>\n<p>The graphic below explains 3 types of baiting done by the attacker to infect PC(s).<\/p>\n<p><img class=\" wp-image-1217 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/teamultimate.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/07\/botnet3-300x232.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 398px) 100vw, 398px\" srcset=\"https:\/\/teamultimate.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/07\/botnet3-300x232.png 300w, https:\/\/teamultimate.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/07\/botnet3.png 650w\" alt=\"\" width=\"398\" height=\"308\" \/><\/p>\n<p>If your computer is part of a botnet, it\u2019s infected with a type of malware. The bot contacts a remote server \u2014 or just gets into contact with other nearby bots \u2014 and waits for instructions from whoever is controlling the botnet. This allows an attacker to control a large number of computers for malicious purposes.<\/p>\n<p>Computers in a botnet may also be infected with other types of malware, like keyloggers that record your financial information and send it to a remote server. What makes a computer part of a botnet is that it\u2019s being controlled remotely along with many other computers. The botnet\u2019s creators can decide what to do with the botnet later, direct the bots to download additional types of malware, and even have the bots act together.<\/p>\n<p>You might become infected with a bot in the same way you\u2019d become infected with any other piece of malware \u2014 for example, by running out-of-date software, using the extremely insecure Java browser plug-in, or downloading and running pirated software.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Botnet_C_Cs\"><\/span>Botnet C&amp;Cs<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>The C&amp;Cs are the servers that deliver commands to the bots, directing them to targets and instructing them what to do. Traditionally, botnets operate under a client-server model, wherein the bots act as the botnet clients and the C&amp;Cs act as the servers. There can be one or more Command and Control servers in a botnet.<\/p>\n<p>Having multiple C&amp;Cs provides redundancy and enables botnets to acquire high availability capabilities. Meaning, if one C&amp;C goes down, the botnet clients can still receive commands from the other C&amp;Cs. Nevertheless, having multiple C&amp;Cs doesn\u2019t make a client-server-type botnet indestructible. Its survival still relies heavily on the C&amp;Cs. If the C&amp;Cs are identified and eventually brought down, the entire botnet will be no more.<\/p>\n<p>This is how massive botnets like Mariposa and Bredolab were dismantled. After their C&amp;Cs were tracked down, the end of these malicious networks became imminent.<\/p>\n<p>Today, many botnets follow a different architecture. To avoid total reliance on a group of C&amp;Cs, these botnets now use a P2P model, wherein each botnet client also functions as a C&amp;C. This type of botnet is much harder to take down.<\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Botnet_Communications\"><\/span><strong>Botnet Communications<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Most bots communicate with their C&amp;Cs using mostly these three communications protocols \u2013 Telnet, IRC (Internet Relay Chat) or HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol). Other botnets also employ other communication methods but these two are definitely the most commonly used.<\/p>\n<p>IRC communications can be easily automated (using scripts). In addition, open source IRC servers are readily available. That\u2019s why this protocol used to be a perfect fit for botnet creation and deployment. During infection, a typical botnet malware would install an IRC client, which in turn would then communicate with the IRC server on the C&amp;C.<\/p>\n<p>The characteristics of IRC, while a boon for botnet operations, has ironically also become many a botnet\u2019s undoing. If you really think about it, Internet Relay Chat is no longer a common method of communication (most people now use Instant Messaging applications). And so, ever since IRC became associated with botnets, the presence of IRC packets has often raised red flags. Some system admins even started blocking IRC packets in their firewalls.<\/p>\n<p>It is for this reason that malware writers have started to turn to a more firewall-friendly option as their botnet communication protocol of choice. And what network protocol can be more firewall-friendly than HTTP? All websites (including popular ones like Google, Facebook, and Amazon) all communicate via HTTP. So if a botnet uses HTTP, there\u2019s a lower chance of it getting flagged down because, unlike IRC packets, HTTP packets don\u2019t easily stand out.<\/p>\n<p>Zeus, one of the most notorious botnets ever, communicated via HTTP. In fact, several exploit kits incorporate HTTP communications into their botnet malware payloads.<\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Botnet_attacks\"><\/span><strong>Botnet attacks<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>One of the most common botnet attacks is the DDoS or Distributed Denial of Service attack. In this type of attack, all bots send out requests to a target server with the purpose of overwhelming it and preventing legitimate requests from getting through or processed.<\/p>\n<p>Another common botnet attack \u2013 in fact, arguably the most common cyber attack that employs botnets \u2013 is sending out tons of spam. In a typical spam attack, bots send out spam emails to target email addresses with the purpose of getting click-throughs and, ultimately, generating ad revenue.<\/p>\n<p>Botnets can also be used to steal information from enslaved devices. Some bot clients operate as keyloggers that record end user keystrokes. Keyloggers can, for example, record the password characters an end user enters during login and then send this information to the bot herders.<\/p>\n<p>Lastly, botnets can also be used for click fraud activities. Bot clients can click on ads and trick ad networks that the clicks came from legitimate end users.<\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Preventing_botnet_attacks\"><\/span><strong>Preventing botnet attacks<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Botnet malware infections can be avoided by educating end-users about the risks and best practices of downloading email attachments and visiting web sites. Of course, this countermeasure has its limitations. Most end users find security practices too tedious and time consuming, and often disregard them. Further, some threats (like drive-by-downloads) are just too difficult to avoid.<\/p>\n<p>The best way would is to employ advanced malware protection solutions. These solutions typically combine advanced network behaviour analysis and real time intelligence to detect even the most stealthy malware infections.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s all for now.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Also Read:\u00a0<\/strong><a href=\"http:\/\/teamultimate.in\/functionality-of-stressers\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Difference between DoS and DDoS.<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Hello everyone!

Check the screenshot below.<br \/>\nWhen the website is not under CloudFlare&#8217;s protection, it will look like this :<\/p>\n<div class=\"separator\"><a href=\"https:\/\/2.bp.blogspot.com\/-cFMWvPS2Pro\/WSkuJWLSD9I\/AAAAAAAAAPk\/bf-6UIQtFt0bYwDhRi-RuHsEz6tXGUPCQCLcB\/s1600\/cf-withoutdns.PNG\"><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/2.bp.blogspot.com\/-cFMWvPS2Pro\/WSkuJWLSD9I\/AAAAAAAAAPk\/bf-6UIQtFt0bYwDhRi-RuHsEz6tXGUPCQCLcB\/s400\/cf-withoutdns.PNG\" width=\"400\" height=\"205\" border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"493\" data-original-width=\"961\" \/><\/a><\/div>\n<p>And when it is under CloudFlare DNS setting then it will be in orange like the below one.<\/p>\n<div class=\"separator\"><a href=\"https:\/\/1.bp.blogspot.com\/-b5wbE_XOeYY\/WSkuRg49gcI\/AAAAAAAAAPo\/NpjRtek9RLkLyeWO2J2llzQJPIgZ2s5BQCLcB\/s1600\/cf-underdns.PNG\"><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/1.bp.blogspot.com\/-b5wbE_XOeYY\/WSkuRg49gcI\/AAAAAAAAAPo\/NpjRtek9RLkLyeWO2J2llzQJPIgZ2s5BQCLcB\/s400\/cf-underdns.PNG\" width=\"400\" height=\"195\" border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"471\" data-original-width=\"961\" \/><\/a><\/div>\n<p>Now check for the upper screenshot.

Let&#8217;s go through all these questions.<\/p>\n<p>Doxing is a term which means an Online user being exposed by a hacker.\u00a0search for and publish private or identifying information about (a particular individual) on the Internet, typically with malicious intent.<\/p>\n<p><b>How do hackers dox us or any other victim?<\/b><br \/>\nDoxing is performed when a hacker have a single and a small clue through which he can find out all details about him. Example a hacker wants to Dox a guy named &#8220;Somdev&#8221;. Is he on facebook? If yes then we can use his facebook username. http:\/\/facebook.com\/somdev.sangwan. So at the end, somdev.sangwan is the username of that victim. Now the hacker will paste the username on Google or any other search engine. If the victim is a blogger then he may surely have updated his information on his blog. It may contain his email or any other information. Through that information he will find out more. He will do\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.shieldsec.org\/2017\/05\/information-gathering-of-domain-name.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Information gathering of the victim&#8217;s domain<\/a>\u00a0and find out his name, address, email, and other information.<\/p>\n<p><b>How to avoid Doxing?\u00a0<\/b><br \/>\nTo avoid Doxing, you should always hide your information from Internet. If you own a domain name then you should invest a little and buy WHOIS Guard through which domain&#8217;s WHOIS Information would get changed. Never post up personal details like email, phone number or etc on your article or blog. Try to not to earn fame because sooner or later it will result for you being a lame.<\/p>\n<p><b>How can Doxing be dangerous?<\/b><br \/>\nDoxing can be very dangerous. After hacker gets the detail about you, he can use it to make fake accounts. Even nowadays details are being sold online on Dark Web. You wouldn&#8217;t really know but if the details are authentic then it can be sold on Internet and can be used for any illegal purposes. It all depends on hacker who have doxed you. It depends on him for what purposes he will use your information for&#8230;.<\/p>\n<p>So be careful and take some precautions while getting yourself online.<\/p>\n<p><i>(Hey!

Clash of Clans cannot be hacked with third party website or application. All those applications are fake.

Such attacks are called DoS attack.<\/div>\n<div class=\"separator\"><\/div>\n<div class=\"separator\"><b>DDoS -Distributed Denial of Service Attack<\/b><\/div>\n<div class=\"separator\">In most respects it is similar to a DoS attack but the results are much, much different. Instead of one computer and one internet connection the DDoS attack utilises many computers and many connections. The computers behind such an attack are often distributed around the whole world and will be part of what is known as a botnet. The main difference between a DDoS attack vs a DoS attack, therefore, is that the target server will be overload by hundreds or even thousands of requests in the case of the former as opposed to just one attacker in the case of the latter.<\/div>\n<div class=\"separator\"><\/div>\n<div class=\"separator\">So which one is powerful?<\/div>\n<div class=\"separator\">As we can see, DoS is a term through which packets are sent from one computer or a connection meanwhile DDoS mean Distributed Denial of Service attack. &#8220;Distributed&#8221; itself defines that the attack&#8217;s responsibility is given to many computers or connections to take down the target.\u00a0<b>Common sense is the more you are the higher you get.<\/b><\/div>\n<div class=\"separator\"><b>\u00a0<\/b><\/div>\n<div class=\"separator\">Also read about\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.shieldsec.org\/2017\/05\/what-is-cloudflare-how-does-it-works.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">CloudFlare<\/a>\u00a0and\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.shieldsec.org\/2017\/05\/an-introduction-to-dos-denial-of-service.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">DoS<\/a>.<\/div>\n<div class=\"separator\"><\/div>\n<div class=\"separator\"><i>(Hey!

Denial of service is typically accomplished by flooding the targeted machine or resource with superfluous requests in an attempt to overload systems and prevent some or all legitimate requests from being fulfilled.<br \/>\nIn a distributed denial-of-service attack (DDoS attack), the incoming traffic flooding the victim originates from many different sources. This effectively makes it impossible to stop the attack simply by blocking a single source.<br \/>\nA DoS or DDoS attack is analogous to a group of people crowding the entry door or gate to a shop or business, and not letting legitimate parties enter into the shop or business, disrupting normal operations.<br \/>\nCriminal perpetrators of DoS attacks often target sites or services hosted on high-profile web servers such as banks or credit card payment gateways. Revenge, blackmail and activism can motivate these attacks.<br \/>\n<b>Types of DoS Attacks<\/b>.<br \/>\nDenial-of-service attacks are characterized by an explicit attempt by attackers to prevent legitimate users of a service from using that service. In a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack, the incoming traffic flooding the victim originates from many different sources \u2013 potentially hundreds of thousands or more. This effectively makes it impossible to stop the attack simply by blocking a single IP address; plus, it is very difficult to distinguish legitimate user traffic from attack traffic when spread across so many points of origin. There are two general forms of DoS attacks: those that crash services and those that flood services. The most serious attacks are distributed.[6] Many attacks involve forging of IP sender addresses (IP address spoofing) so that the location of the attacking machines cannot easily be identified and so that the attack cannot be easily defeated using ingress filtering.<br \/>\nCourt testimony shows that the first demonstration of DoS attack was made by Khan C. Smith in 1997 during a DEFCON event disrupting Internet access to the Las Vegas Strip for over an hour and the release of sample code during the event led to the online attack of Sprint, EarthLink, E-Trade, and other major corporations in the year to follow.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>What is DoS?

Does it host website on their webserver? No, They don&#8217;t host website but in simple way we can say that it builds a wall between the Host and the visitor of that specific website. The picture below explains the chart when a site is not under CloudFlare protection and when it is under protection.<\/p>\n<div class=\"separator\"><a href=\"https:\/\/4.bp.blogspot.com\/-un3i9jC7_00\/WRQG2niNQFI\/AAAAAAAAALM\/-D4mx6Ly0k0MP0Gvg5AdTLzaOMNJgLU6wCEw\/s1600\/cloudflare%2Bfunction.png\"><img src=\"https:\/\/4.bp.blogspot.com\/-un3i9jC7_00\/WRQG2niNQFI\/AAAAAAAAALM\/-D4mx6Ly0k0MP0Gvg5AdTLzaOMNJgLU6wCEw\/s640\/cloudflare%2Bfunction.png\" width=\"640\" height=\"320\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><\/div>\n<p>It means when a website is under CloudFlare, visitors and crawlers are given access to the website but attackers aren&#8217;t given the access.<br \/>\nHere is the explanation by CloudFlare team &#8220;How does CloudFlare works?&#8221;<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">\n<blockquote class=\"tr_bq\"><p><i>Cloudflare is designed to accelerate and secure any website. Our system works somewhat like a Content Delivery Network (CDN), but is designed to be much easier to setup and configure.<\/i><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<blockquote class=\"tr_bq\"><p><i>To explain how the system works, imagine you have a website (allen.com) and it&#8217;s running a web server with the IP address of 1.1.1.1. Before Cloudflare, if someone typed your website&#8217;s domain (allen.com) into their browser, the first thing that visitor&#8217;s computer would do is send a query to the DNS system and get back your web server&#8217;s IP address (1.1.1.1).<\/i><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<blockquote class=\"tr_bq\"><p><i>In order to make Cloudflare easy to set up, we take advantage of how this basic function of the Internet works. Rather than having you add hardware, install software, or change your code, we have you designate two Cloudflare nameservers as the authoritative nameservers for your domain (e.g., bob.ns.cloudflare.com and sara.ns.cloudflare.com). You make this change with the registrar from which you bought your domain (e.g., GoDaddy, Network Solutions, Register.com, etc.).<\/i><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<blockquote class=\"tr_bq\"><p><i>Designating Cloudflare as your authoritative nameservers doesn&#8217;t change anything about your website. Your registrar remains your registrar, your hosting provider remains your hosting provider, and so on. However, because we are your authoritative nameserver, we can begin cleaning and accelerating your web traffic.<\/i><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<blockquote class=\"tr_bq\"><p><i>To make this happen we use a network routing technology called Anycast (and some other fancy tricks) to route initial DNS lookups for your domain to a Cloudflare data center closest to the visitor. We have data centers around the world and we\u2019re growing every month. The data center that receives the request returns an answer in the form of an IP address (e.g., 99.99.99.99), which directs all the visitor&#8217;s subsequent requests to the best data center for them.<\/i><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<blockquote class=\"tr_bq\"><p><i>After a visitor&#8217;s browser has done the initial DNS lookup, it begins making requests to retrieve the actual content of a website. These requests are directed to the IP address that was returned from the DNS lookup. Before Cloudflare, that would have been 1.1.1.1, with Cloudflare as the authoritative nameserver that would be 99.99.99.99 (or some other address depending on what Cloudflare data center is closest to the user). Cloudflare&#8217;s edge servers running on that IP address receive the request and perform analysis on it. We scan to see if the visitor appears to be a threat based a number of characteristics including the visitor&#8217;s IP address, what resource they are requesting, what payload they are posting, how frequently they&#8217;re making requests, etc.<\/i><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<blockquote class=\"tr_bq\"><p><i>To speed up the response time for a request that goes to one of our frontline servers, Cloudflare caches parts of websites that are static in these servers. For example, we cache things like images, CSS, and JavaScript. We are very conservative with our caching because we never want to mess up dynamic content. So, for example, as a general rule we do not cache HTML. We also refresh the cache relatively frequently, so files are never more than a few hours old. Even being conservative, however, typically 50% of the resources on any given web page are cacheable.<\/i><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<blockquote class=\"tr_bq\"><p><i>Assuming the visitor is not a threat, the frontline checks the request against the Cached resources on our front line servers to see if the resource being requested is in Cloudflare\u2019s local cache. If we have a local copy of the file being requested, then we can deliver it directly to the visitor from a local data center greatly increasing request response time.<\/i><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<blockquote class=\"tr_bq\"><p><i>If the request is for a type of resource we don&#8217;t cache, or if we don&#8217;t have a current copy in our cache, then we make a request from our data center (99.99.99.99) back to your origin server (1.1.1.1). Because of our scale, we can get premium routes from our data centers back to most places on the Internet. As a result, while it may seem counter-intuitive, it is sometimes the case that the number of &#8220;hops&#8221; a visitor\u2019s request makes going through the Cloudflare network is less than the number of &#8220;hops&#8221; that they would have made going to the origin web server directly, even when we aren&#8217;t able to return a result from our cache.<\/i><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<blockquote class=\"tr_bq\"><p><i>The combination of these systems means that we can protect sites from malicious visitors by stopping them before they even get to the origin web server, save over 60% of the bandwidth that a site would otherwise have to pay for, save over 65% of the requests that would otherwise have to be handled by a site, and cut in half average page load times. In order to make performance even better, we also do web content optimization.<\/i><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>But their is an increase in terrorism through CloudFlare, What? How can be terrorism spread behind CloudFlare? As per media and some activist cyber groups, Terrorists organisation like LeT, ISIS and etc are protecting website under CloudFlare and they are paying to CloudFlare to make themselves protective against the attack by Law Enforcement agencies. CloudFlare is bad-rated in these cases.<\/p>\n<p><b>How to bypass CloudFlare?<\/b><br \/>\nIf the owner of the website haven&#8217;t configured CloudFlare carefully, it can be bypassed and we can get the real IP of that website which is hiding behind CloudFlare.

It&#8217;s actually a cool thing, also bad thing and depending on how you use your knowledge. For helping peoples, for bad purposes, for hacking government as a sign of protest and etc. Some thinks that they are hacker when they hack games like candy crush or clash of clans or whatsoever by third party apps. Actually hacking is a term where no one can become a perfect hacker. Some noobs think that they installed Kali Linux and became hacker, what? Now do you even know how to operate the thing you installed? No, you don&#8217;t know. So for becoming a hacker needs you to be a person with willingness to learn everything in terms of &#8220;hacking&#8221; because 95\/100 peoples just wants to become hacker to know &#8220;how to hack wifi&#8221;,&#8221;how to hack clash of clans and get unlimited golds,elixar,gems&#8221;,&#8221;how to hack fb&#8221;and etc. To become a hacker, you must have willingness and paitence at most. Now let&#8217;s start with our basics need to become a hacker.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div><b>Joining groups<\/b><\/div>\n<div>Joining groups is the first thing that will inspire you for becoming a hacker. You will see hackers doing activities like defacing websites, getting access to the server, hacking into public wifi and doing MITM(man in the middle attack) and etc. This is make you understand what you can do in future after becoming a hacker and what you need to learn as a hacker.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div><b>Using Linux regularly<\/b><\/div>\n<div>Why to use Linux? It is because nowadays 95% of hacking activities are executed using Linux computing. It&#8217;s just like you started using Windows, you came to know about games, you hacked them via third party applications like &#8220;Cheat engine&#8221; and etc. It&#8217;s just the same. Linux will provide you many modules which will help you to sharpen your knowledge in Linux computing and becoming a hacker. Also another reason is 90% of hacking scripts are made of python, perl and other linux programming languages. Yes, You can use them on windows too but installing them on Linux is way easier then you think. Just few words command on terminal and you are all done!<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div><b>Use search engines for your needs<\/b>.<\/div>\n<div>Using search engine is one of the most important thing that will optimize your way of learning in cyber world. Disturbing someone else for your questions is the worst thing. The person whom you are asking may get angry. You know how they become hacker? The thing is using search engine. Search Engine digs out whole Internet and finds you the relevant results for your query. If you have a problem with your Internet connection, how to boost it? If you ask your friend who is expert in these, do you even know when will he reply? Or maybe get angry from you because you kept asking him &#8220;how to do this&#8221;, &#8220;how to do that?&#8221;. Using search engine isn&#8217;t a big deal. Open them, type in what you want to search! It&#8217;s that simple! Also you can do research on your topic using search engine.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div><b>Getting Anonymous<\/b><\/div>\n<div>Hiding yourself is a big deal. You can&#8217;t become a hacker sitting in jail. When you do hacking, you do on servers, websites and mostly without permission which can result in jail. So hiding yourself in this Cyber world is the most important thing in Cyber world. Because Law Enforcement agencies like CIA, NSA, FBI and etc are having a watch on you and your activities. Also as per Rule 45, FBI have permission to hack any computer around the world. So to avoid yourself being exposed or hacked, You need to hide your identities using VPNs, RDPs,Proxies and etc..<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<h3>Learning To Code<\/h3>\n<div>Learning to code is another most important thing. You need to learn how to code because you may need it. You need to understand the algorithm and learn how do they actually work. It is the most important thing because if you understand the algorithm and you know how to code, then you can code anything, any program, any exploit which will help you hack anything. Various types of coding which will help you in writing exploits and programs are C,C++,Python,Perl,Ruby,PHP(WebI) and etc.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>We will continue with our topic and explore more points through which we can become a great hacker.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div><i>(If you think that this article needs any improvement then you are welcomed in our comment box below!

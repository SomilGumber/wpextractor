The most basic thing is obviously, connecting to the VPS. You can do it by using the SSH Client called Putty. It will help you to connect to your VPS/server.

But there is nothing to worry about.

All you have to do is change this from that. Let&#8217;s first open the file.</p>\n<pre>nano phpMyAdmin.conf\r\n</pre>\n<p>Now find these lines:</p>\n<pre>Alias /phpMyAdmin /usr/share/phpMyAdmin\r\nAlias /phpmyadmin /usr/share/phpMyAdmin\r\n</pre>\n<p>&#8230;and change them to:</p>\n<pre>#Alias /phpMyAdmin /usr/share/phpMyAdmin\r\n#Alias /phpmyadmin /usr/share/phpMyAdmin\r\n</pre>\n<p>..by adding &#8220;#&#8221; or symbolic &#8220;hash&#8221; to comment on those lines.

Save it by pressing CTRL + X and then press &#8220;Y&#8221; and then &#8220;Enter&#8221; key. It means, &#8220;/phpmyadmin&#8221; will now show 404 error and &#8220;/thisismyphpmyadmin&#8221; will open the PHPMyAdmin interface. Alternatively, you can add more of those lines after the new line and allow PHPMyAdmin to open at whatever address you want.</p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Step_4_%E2%80%93_Finalizing_Restarting\"></span>Step 4 &#8211; Finalizing &amp; Restarting<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"></span></h3>\n<p>But for it to be in effect, you have to restart the Apache.

Launched back in 2004, GTA San Andreas has gained popularity and fame among the gaming world that even today, more than a decade ago, people still like it and do play it on a daily basis. A year after the game was launched, an online, 3rd party interface, was launched by a sole developer who was later participated by beta testers from all over the world as it gained popularity. Before SA:MP, people used to play MTA SA which stands for Multi Theft Auto San Andreas.</p>\n<div id=\"ez-toc-container\" class=\"ez-toc-v2_0_11 counter-hierarchy counter-decimal ez-toc-grey\">\n<div class=\"ez-toc-title-container\">\n<p class=\"ez-toc-title\">Table of Contents</p>\n<span class=\"ez-toc-title-toggle\"><a class=\"ez-toc-pull-right ez-toc-btn ez-toc-btn-xs ez-toc-btn-default ez-toc-toggle\"><i class=\"ez-toc-glyphicon ez-toc-icon-toggle\"></i></a></span></div>\n<nav><ul class=\"ez-toc-list ez-toc-list-level-1\"><li class=\"ez-toc-page-1 ez-toc-heading-level-2\"><a class=\"ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-1\" href=\"https://shadowhosting.net/blog/installing-samp-on-debian-9/#What_Is_SAMP\" title=\"What Is SAMP?\">What Is SAMP?</a></li><li class=\"ez-toc-page-1 ez-toc-heading-level-2\"><a class=\"ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-2\" href=\"https://shadowhosting.net/blog/installing-samp-on-debian-9/#How_To_Install_SAMP_Server_on_Debian_9_VPS/Dedicated_Server\" title=\"How To Install SAMP Server on Debian 9 VPS/Dedicated Server?\">How To Install SAMP Server on Debian 9 VPS/Dedicated Server?</a><ul class=\"ez-toc-list-level-3\"><li class=\"ez-toc-heading-level-3\"><a class=\"ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-3\" href=\"https://shadowhosting.net/blog/installing-samp-on-debian-9/#Step_1_%E2%80%93_Installing_Updating_Required_packages_for_SAMP_Server\" title=\"Step 1 \u2013 Installing &amp; Updating Required packages for SAMP Server\">Step 1 \u2013 Installing &amp; Updating Required packages for SAMP Server</a></li><li class=\"ez-toc-page-1 ez-toc-heading-level-3\"><a class=\"ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-4\" href=\"https://shadowhosting.net/blog/installing-samp-on-debian-9/#Step_2_%E2%80%93_Downloading_Configuring_SAMP_Package\" title=\"Step 2 &#8211; Downloading &amp; Configuring SAMP Package\">Step 2 &#8211; Downloading &amp; Configuring SAMP Package</a></li><li class=\"ez-toc-page-1 ez-toc-heading-level-3\"><a class=\"ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-5\" href=\"https://shadowhosting.net/blog/installing-samp-on-debian-9/#Step_3_%E2%80%93_Configuring_your_server_package\" title=\"Step 3 \u2013 Configuring your server package\">Step 3 \u2013 Configuring your server package</a></li><li class=\"ez-toc-page-1 ez-toc-heading-level-3\"><a class=\"ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-6\" href=\"https://shadowhosting.net/blog/installing-samp-on-debian-9/#Step_4_%E2%80%93_Setting_files_permission\" title=\"Step 4 \u2013 Setting files permission\">Step 4 \u2013 Setting files permission</a></li><li class=\"ez-toc-page-1 ez-toc-heading-level-3\"><a class=\"ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-7\" href=\"https://shadowhosting.net/blog/installing-samp-on-debian-9/#Step_5_%E2%80%93_Starting_the_server\" title=\"Step 5 \u2013 Starting the server\">Step 5 \u2013 Starting the server</a></li></ul></li><li class=\"ez-toc-page-1 ez-toc-heading-level-2\"><a class=\"ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-8\" href=\"https://shadowhosting.net/blog/installing-samp-on-debian-9/#Start_Your_Own_SAMP_Server_With_Shadow_Hosting!\" title=\"Start Your Own SAMP Server With Shadow Hosting!\">Start Your Own SAMP Server With Shadow Hosting!</a></li></ul></nav></div>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"What_Is_SAMP\"></span><span id=\"What_Is_SAMP\" class=\"ez-toc-section\">What Is SAMP?</span><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"></span></h2>\n<p>SA-MP (San Andreas Multiplayer) is a multiplayer mod for Grand Theft Auto San Andreas allowing users to play against each other over the internet or LAN. To connect to a SAMP server over the Internet, there should be a server that needs to have an active Internet connection to allow players to connect from multiple computers from all over the world.</p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"How_To_Install_SAMP_Server_on_Debian_9_VPS/Dedicated_Server\"></span><span id=\"How_To_Install_SAMP_Server_on_CentOS_7_VPSDedicated_Server\" class=\"ez-toc-section\">How To Install SAMP Server on Debian 9 VPS/Dedicated Server?</span><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"></span></h2>\n<p>In this article, we\u2019re going to learn how to install a SAMP server on a Debian 9 machine. To connect to the machine, one should have SSH client, Putty installed in order, to begin with. If you don\u2019t know how to connect to VPS, refer to <a href=\"https://shadowhosting.net/blog/connecting-vps-using-putty/\">this article</a>\u00a0for proper instructions on connecting to a VPS.</p>\n<p>We will be installing SAMP on the machine with multiple steps. So once you\u2019ve connected to the machine, use the following steps to begin installing.</p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Step_1_%E2%80%93_Installing_Updating_Required_packages_for_SAMP_Server\"></span><span id=\"Step_1_Installing_Updating_Required_packages_for_SAMP_Server\" class=\"ez-toc-section\">Step 1 \u2013 Installing &amp; Updating Required packages for SAMP Server</span><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"></span></h3>\n<p>There are a few packages that are required to be installed on the machine. Use the below mentioned commands to install and update the services. Some packages are included which we would need to configure the server later.</p>\n<pre>apt install sudo\r\nsudo apt update &amp;&amp; apt upgrade</pre>\n<p>Sudo is used to grant access to our package up-gradation process. Updating and upgrading may take up to 10 minutes to be finished. Once done, follow up to the next step on installing some essential libraries used in samp03svr operation.</p>\n<pre>apt install libstdc++6 wget nano</pre>\n<p>Now we&#8217;ve installed the library, wget, and nano.</p>\n<p>The difference between CentOS 7 &amp; Debian 9 is that Debian wouldn&#8217;t let you run a 32bit file in a 64bit server. To make the server run, you need to add support for 32bit too. To do so, use the below-mentioned command.</p>\n<pre>sudo dpkg --add-architecture i386\r\nsudo apt-get update\r\nsudo apt-get install libc6:i386 libncurses5:i386 libstdc++6:i386\r\n</pre>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Step_2_%E2%80%93_Downloading_Configuring_SAMP_Package\"></span>Step 2 &#8211; Downloading &amp; Configuring SAMP Package<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"></span></h3>\n<p>Now since we&#8217;ve installed packages and libraries, it&#8217;s time to install the main, SAMP package. To do so, use the following command.</p>\n<pre>wget http://files.sa-mp.com/samp037svr_R2-1.tar.gz</pre>\n<p>This will automatically download the package. As you can see, the file ends with a \u201c.tar.gz\u201d extension, it means it is compressed. To decompress, we need to use this command.</p>\n<pre>tar -zxf samp037svr_R2-1.tar.gz</pre>\n<p>With the command, the file will be decompressed and a new file named \u201csamp03\u201d will appear. We will need to configure it.</p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Step_3_%E2%80%93_Configuring_your_server_package\"></span><span id=\"Step_3_Configuring_your_server_package\" class=\"ez-toc-section\">Step 3 \u2013 Configuring your server package</span><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"></span></h3>\n<p>To configure the package we\u2019ve downloaded, we need to follow this step. First of all, we need to access the newly created folder after decompressing the package we\u2019ve downloaded. To access, use the \u201ccd\u201d command.</p>\n<pre>cd samp03</pre>\n<p>Now since we\u2019re inside the SAMP package directory, you may want to see which files are there. To do that, use this command.</p>\n<pre>ls</pre>\n<p>After that, you\u2019ll see the list of files in the directory. By default, the SAMP server will not start unless we change its RCON password from \u201cchangeme\u2019 to something else. To do that, we need to edit and configure the\u00a0<em>server.cfg</em>\u00a0file. Use the below-mentioned command to access the server.cfg file.</p>\n<pre>nano server.cfg</pre>\n<p>You will see the list of configuration that is awaiting to be changed. You will see something like this.</p>\n<pre>echo Executing Server Config...\r\nlanmode 0\r\nrcon_password changeme\r\nmaxplayers 50\r\nport 7777\r\nhostname SA-MP 0.3 Server\r\ngamemode0 grandlarc 1\r\nfilterscripts base gl_actions gl_property gl_realtime\r\nannounce 0\r\nquery 1\r\nweburl www.sa-mp.com\r\nmaxnpc 0\r\nonfoot_rate 40\r\nincar_rate 40\r\nweapon_rate 40\r\nstream_distance 300.0\r\nstream_rate 1000\r\n</pre>\n<p>Now scroll your edit pointer to \u201crcon_password\u201d and remove &#8216;changeme&#8217; and add your desired password. Make sure the password doesn\u2019t contain any spaces in it. Max players can be defined to set the maximum number of players connected to the server(max limited by SAMP is 1000). Gamemode0 is the script you will upload to provide in-game features to your players and filterscript acts like plugins. \u201cannounce\u201d means whether to allow the server to be displayed in the \u201cInternet\u201d tab or no, it\u2019s boolean so 1 means yes and 0 means no. The query as it is and for weburl set the website URL of your SAMP server.</p>\n<p>You don\u2019t really have to edit it all unless you want to, but just make sure you edit the \u201crcon_password changeme\u201d to \u201crcon_password somethingelse\u201d where \u201csomethingelse\u201d is your RCON password which can be used to access your server remotely.</p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Step_4_%E2%80%93_Setting_files_permission\"></span><span id=\"Step_4_Setting_files_permission\" class=\"ez-toc-section\">Step 4 \u2013 Setting files permission</span><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"></span></h3>\n<p>Sometimes files downloaded from the SAMP website are locked due to its pre-configuration that came along with the files. To unlock the file and make it accessible, use the following command to set proper permissions for all the files in the \u201csamp03\u201d directory.</p>\n<pre>chmod +x *\r\n</pre>\n<p>Now your SAMP server is configured. It\u2019s time to try on with the server.</p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Step_5_%E2%80%93_Starting_the_server\"></span><span id=\"Step_5_Starting_the_server\" class=\"ez-toc-section\">Step 5 \u2013 Starting the server</span><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"></span></h3>\n<p>To test if the server is working fine, you need to start it. To start, use the following command to execute the start file \u201csamp03svr\u201d.</p>\n<pre>./samp03svr</pre>\n<p>Now your server is started. Use your machine\u2019s hostname or IP and paste it in your SAMP client\u2019s favorite. You will see your server running. But what happens when you close the Putty? Well, the server closes too. But why? It is because we\u2019ve just executed and we need to keep it alive even after we close Putty. To do that, we will use the nohup command. Use the following command to do that.</p>\n<pre>nohup ./samp03svr</pre>\n<p>You will see something like this.</p>\n<pre>[root@bot samp03]# nohup ./samp03svr\r\nnohup: ignoring input and appending output to \u2018nohup.out\u2019\r\n</pre>\n<p>It means the server has started and will work even after you close your Putty.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Start_Your_Own_SAMP_Server_With_Shadow_Hosting!\"></span><span id=\"Start_Your_Own_SAMP_Server_With_Shadow_Hosting\" class=\"ez-toc-section\">Start Your Own SAMP Server With Shadow Hosting!</span><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"></span></h2>\n<p>Planning to start your own SAMP server?

It consists of \u201cStart\u201d, \u201cStop\u201d, \u201cRestart\u201d and other necessary buttons required to operate a game server without logging into SSH of the server. In simple words, it is a web application, a collection of PHP files and MySQL database. It is useless without a remote server, ie, an agent.</p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"OGP_Agent\"></span><span id=\"OGP_Agent\" class=\"ez-toc-section\">OGP Agent</span><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"></span></h3>\n<p>As mentioned above, the OGP Panel is useless without a remote server, aka, an agent. OGP Agent is a remote/local server which is where the games are hosted. The panel first connects to the agent and then the panel operator can make a game server. When an action/operation is executed through the panel, the panel sends a request to the agent and that is where it is processed.</p>\n<p>In this article, we\u2019re gonna learn how to install OGP Panel on a fresh Debian 9 VPS/dedicated server. Before we begin, let\u2019s take a look at system requirements.</p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"System_Requirements\"></span><span id=\"System_Requirements\" class=\"ez-toc-section\">System Requirements</span><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"></span></h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Minimum 512 MB RAM</li>\n<li>4 GB minimum disk space</li>\n<li>At least 1 vCore/Core</li>\n<li>Debian 9 OS(For this tutorial, we\u2019ll be using Debian 9.

If you don\u2019t know how to, read this article to know\u00a0<a href=\"https://shadowhosting.net/blog/connecting-vps-using-putty/\">how to connect to a VPS using Putty</a>.</p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Step_1_%E2%80%93_Updating_Upgrading_packages\"></span><span id=\"Step_1_Installing_required_packages\" class=\"ez-toc-section\">Step 1 \u2013 Updating &amp; Upgrading packages.</span><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"></span></h3>\n<p>Before we begin installing packages, we need to update and then upgrade existing packages which includes some serious ones such as kernel files and etc. We&#8217;ll also install sudo in the machine as it needs to be installed for sudo privilege. Debian 9 doesn&#8217;t come up with sudo already installed so we have to install manually. So to avoid any conflict or version problem, let&#8217;s get started.</p>\n<pre>apt update &amp;&amp; apt upgrade\r\napt install sudo\r\n\r\n</pre>\n<p>The above command will update and then upgrade all existing packages. All you have to do is to press &#8220;Y&#8221; when asked and then press Enter so that it updates itself. Don&#8217;t hurry or worry as this may take up to 10 minutes to get fully upgraded.</p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Step_2_%E2%80%93_Installing_Required_Packages\"></span>Step 2 &#8211; Installing Required Packages<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"></span></h3>\n<p>To run OGP, we have to install a few packages that will allow OGP to perform various tasks. To install them, write the following command.</p>\n<pre>sudo apt-get install apache2 curl subversion php7.0 php7.0-gd php7.0-zip libapache2-mod-php7.0 php7.0-curl php7.0-mysql php7.0-xmlrpc php-pear phpmyadmin mysql-server php7.0-mbstring php-gettext git php-bcmath</pre>\n<p>As said before, press &#8220;Y&#8221; then press Enter wherever asked.</p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Step_3_%E2%80%93_Installing_MySQL_Server\"></span>Step 3 &#8211; Installing MySQL Server<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"></span></h3>\n<p>For processing data through the server, we&#8217;d obviously need a database. To do so, we&#8217;ll use MySQL. In Debian 9, we will use MariaDB to install MySQL. Run the following command to install MariaDB.</p>\n<pre>apt install mariadb-server</pre>\n<p>It is now has been installed. Now let&#8217;s set it up.</p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Step_4_%E2%80%93_Setting_up_MySQL_Server\"></span>Step 4 &#8211; Setting up MySQL Server<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"></span></h3>\n<p>MySQL has been installed. To set up, use the following command.</p>\n<pre>mysql_secure_installation</pre>\n<p>Now it will ask for a few things. Firstly, it will ask you for entering the MySQL root password. But since it is a fresh installation, press Enter without entering the password and we\u2019ll go on the next step.</p>\n<pre>Enter current password for root (enter for none):</pre>\n<p>Now the next step would ask if you want to set up a MySQL root password. Press \u201cY\u201d for it. Enter the new password.</p>\n<pre>Set root password? [Y/n] y\r\nNew password:\r\nRe-enter new password:\r\nPassword updated successfully!\r\nReloading privilege tables...\r\n ... Success!\r\n</pre>\n<p>Now it will ask for the next few questions. They don\u2019t need much explanation so just follow the instructions as mentioned below.</p>\n<pre>Remove anonymous users? [Y/n] Y\r\n ... Success!\r\nDisallow root login remotely? [Y/n] Y\r\n ... Success!\r\nRemove test database and access to it? [Y/n] Y\r\n - Dropping test database...\r\n ... Success!\r\n - Removing privileges on test database...\r\n ...

Wait till it finishes.</p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Step_6_%E2%80%93_Setting_Up_MySQL_For_OGP\"></span>Step 6 &#8211; Setting Up MySQL For OGP<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"></span></h3>\n<p>We&#8217;ve installed OGP and now we need a database to set it up. To make a database, you don&#8217;t need any manual intervention. All you need is the root MySQL server password which you used in the 4th step.</p>\n<pre>sudo mysql_secure_installation</pre>\n<p>This will begin with the MySQL Setup. Make note that this is required for a fresh machine ONLY. If you already have MySQL set up on your server, skip this step. It will then ask if you already have the MySQL password set up. Press Enter. Then following the steps. It will ask you to enter the MySQL password twice for confirmation. The password, nor asterisk will show up with the password section for security reasons.</p>\n<pre>Set root password? [Y/n] Y\r\nNew password:\r\nRe-enter new password:\r\nPassword updated successfully!\r\nReloading privilege tables..\r\n ... Success!\r\nRemove anonymous users? [Y/n] Y\r\n ... Success!\r\nDisallow root login remotely? [Y/n] Y\r\n ... Success!\r\nRemove test database and access to it? [Y/n] Y\r\n - Dropping test database...\r\n ... Success!\r\n - Removing privileges on test database...\r\n ... Success!\r\nReload privilege tables now? [Y/n] Y\r\n ... Success!\r\n\r\nCleaning up...\r\n\r\nAll done!  If you've completed all of the above steps, your MariaDB\r\ninstallation should now be secure.\r\n</pre>\n<p>Now since we&#8217;ve done setting up MySQL, it&#8217;s time to go for OGP Panel. We&#8217;ll need to pull it from it&#8217;s Github repository and then install it with dpkg.</p>\n<pre>wget -N \"https://github.com/OpenGamePanel/Easy-Installers/raw/master/Linux/Debian-Ubuntu/ogp-panel-latest.deb\" -O \"ogp-panel-latest.deb\"\r\nsudo dpkg -i \"ogp-panel-latest.deb\"\r\n</pre>\n<p>After pulling and installing OGP, it will automate the database connection by asking you just the root password so that it can create a separate user and a database for OGP. Once you&#8217;re done entering the root password, you will see MySQL credentials like this:</p>\n<pre>MySQL Host: localhost\r\nMySQL User: ogpuser\r\nMySQL User Password: vttveSxQlMp5\r\nMySQL Database Name: ogp_panel\r\n</pre>\n<p>Copy it and paste it in notepad as we&#8217;ll require it in setting up MySQL for OGP via web-interface.</p>\n<p><img class=\" wp-image-193 aligncenter\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/shadowhosting.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/debian9-ogp-fp.png?resize=432%2C512&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"432\" height=\"512\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/shadowhosting.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/debian9-ogp-fp.png?resize=253%2C300&amp;ssl=1 253w, https://i2.wp.com/shadowhosting.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/debian9-ogp-fp.png?w=736&amp;ssl=1 736w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 432px) 100vw, 432px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<p>You will see something like the above.

But for a simple WordPress website, we&#8217;d take the following specs.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Debian 9 as OS(Of course!)</li>\n<li>512 MB of RAM</li>\n<li>20 GB of minimum space</li>\n<li>1 vCore</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Time to head for installation.</p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Installing_LAMP_Stack_on_Debian_9_Server\"></span>Installing LAMP Stack on Debian 9 Server<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"></span></h2>\n<p>Before we begin the installation, we should note that our machine is in the fresh installation phase. To do all this, you need access to the terminal. Access the terminal of your server by learning how to connect to a server using putty.</p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Step_1_%E2%80%93_Updating_The_Packages\"></span>Step 1 &#8211; Updating The Packages<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"></span></h3>\n<p>There might be many packages pending updates. To update them, run the following command in your terminal.</p>\n<pre>apt update &amp;&amp; apt upgrade &amp;&amp; apt dist-upgrade</pre>\n<p>This will upgrade the machine to bring in the latest update of the packages.</p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Step_2_%E2%80%93_Installing_Apache\"></span>Step 2 &#8211; Installing Apache<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"></span></h3>\n<p>Now it&#8217;s time to install the webserver, Apache. Along with the package, we will also install a few of the very essential tools that we will need in the future. To do so, run the following commands.</p>\n<pre>apt install apache2 wget nano</pre>\n<p>Press Y if asked and follow the instructions until the installation is completed.</p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Step_3_%E2%80%93_Installing_the_%E2%80%9CM%E2%80%9DySQL_system_called_MariaDB\"></span>Step 3 &#8211; Installing the &#8220;M&#8221;ySQL system called MariaDB<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"></span></h3>\n<p>To run a website, you would need a database to see, input, edit, delete and other actions for data. To do so, you need a database and we&#8217;ll do it by installing MariaDB. Run the following command to install MariaDB.</p>\n<pre>apt install mariadb-server</pre>\n<p>Press Y and follow the steps accordingly.</p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Step_4_%E2%80%93_Setting_up_MariaDB\"></span>Step 4 &#8211; Setting up MariaDB<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"></span></h3>\n<p>Now since MariaDB is downloaded and installed, we would need to set up the database. To do so, let&#8217;s type the setup command.</p>\n<pre>mysql_secure_installation</pre>\n<p>Now it will ask for a few things. Firstly, it will ask you for entering the MySQL root password. But since it is a fresh installation, press Enter without entering the password and we&#8217;ll go on the next step.</p>\n<pre>Enter current password for root (enter for none):</pre>\n<p>Now the next step would ask if you want to set up a MySQL root password. Press &#8220;Y&#8221; for it. Enter the new password.</p>\n<pre>Set root password? [Y/n] y\r\nNew password:\r\nRe-enter new password:\r\nPassword updated successfully!\r\nReloading privilege tables...\r\n ... Success!\r\n</pre>\n<p>Now it will ask for the next few questions. They don&#8217;t need much explanation so just follow the instructions as mentioned below.</p>\n<pre>Remove anonymous users? [Y/n] Y\r\n ... Success!\r\nDisallow root login remotely? [Y/n] Y\r\n ... Success!\r\nRemove test database and access to it? [Y/n] Y\r\n - Dropping test database...\r\n ... Success!\r\n - Removing privileges on test database...\r\n ... Success!\r\nReload privilege tables now? [Y/n] Y\r\n</pre>\n<p>We&#8217;re now done setting up MySQL. Let&#8217;s make a separate user for MySQL so that we can differ it from the root. To do so, let&#8217;s get into MariaDB. To do so, type the following command.</p>\n<pre>mariadb\r\n</pre>\n<p>We&#8217;ll create a user named &#8220;<strong>master</strong>&#8221; and grant it full root access.</p>\n<pre>MariaDB [(none)]&gt; GRANT ALL ON *.* TO 'master'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'P@Ssw0rD2020' WITH GRANT OPTION;</pre>\n<p>Copy the part from &#8220;<strong>GRANT &#8230;</strong>&#8221; . Now let&#8217;s flush the privileges that are saved in the current login session.</p>\n<pre>FLUSH PRIVILEGES;</pre>\n<p>Exit the session as we&#8217;re done with it by using the following commands.</p>\n<pre>exit</pre>\n<p>Now to access the database next time, let&#8217;s use the following command.</p>\n<pre>mariadb -u master -p\r\n</pre>\n<p>We&#8217;ve come this far and successfully installed Apache &amp; MariaDB. Let&#8217;s now head towards installing PHP.</p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Step_5_%E2%80%93_Installing_PHP\"></span>Step 5 &#8211; Installing PHP<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"></span></h3>\n<p>PHP is a part of your setup that processes dynamic code and runs stuff in the background. It can be used to connect to the MariaDB database to process data into information and display it to the web page.</p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s install PHP using the following command.</p>\n<pre>apt install php libapache2-mod-php php-mysql\r\n</pre>\n<p>Press &#8220;Y&#8221; and then Enter. Continue the steps to finish installing PHP.</p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Step_6_%E2%80%93_Testing_PHP\"></span>Step 6 &#8211; Testing PHP<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"></span></h3>\n<p>Let&#8217;s test the PHP as we&#8217;re done installing it. To do so, we&#8217;ll first have to restart the webserver as we didn&#8217;t do it after post-installation. To do so, run the following command.</p>\n<pre>service apache2 restart</pre>\n<p>We&#8217;ve successfully restarted Apache. Now let&#8217;s test PHP. To do so, we&#8217;d need to go to the directory where the website files would be located. Type the following command to head there.</p>\n<pre>cd /var/www/html</pre>\n<p>We&#8217;re in the directory. Let&#8217;s type</p>\n<pre>ls</pre>\n<p>and see what files are here. In a fresh installation, we&#8217;d find a default html file named</p>\n<pre>index.html</pre>\n<p>Let&#8217;s remove it by doing</p>\n<pre>rm -rf info.php</pre>\n<p>Now the directory is clean. Type the following command to make a new file as index.php.</p>\n<pre>nano info.php</pre>\n<p>Enter the below code and paste it into nano.<br />\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-184\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/shadowhosting.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/phpinfocode.png?resize=107%2C72&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"107\" height=\"72\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><br />\nNow <strong>CTRL + X then press Y then Enter again</strong>.

Cloudflare&#8217;s services sit between the visitor and the Cloudflare user&#8217;s hosting provider, acting as a reverse proxy for websites.</p></blockquote>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"How_do_Cloudflare_works\"></span>How do Cloudflare works?<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"></span></h3>\n<figure style=\"width: 590px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/support.cloudflare.com/hc/article_attachments/360029342112/What_is_Cloudflare_v7.png?resize=590%2C405&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Image result for cloudflare\" width=\"590\" height=\"405\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Credits:- <a href=\"https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/205177068-How-does-Cloudflare-work-\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Cloudflare Support Blog</a></figcaption></figure>\n<p>As shown in the above figure, Cloudflare acts as a wall between malicious traffic, safe traffic, hacker&#8217;s traffic, and your website. It allows only safe traffic and necessary search engine crawlers. Other fake crawlers and spiders are rejected and shown a captcha which one cannot easily bypass(as a robot).</p>\n<p>It also provides a built-in WAF or web application firewall which can protect your website against malicious codes being injected into it.</p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"How_To_Bypass_It\"></span>How To Bypass It?<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"></span></h3>\n<p>Okay, now so we&#8217;ll begin to learn how to bypass Cloudflare protection. This can be used as a method of pentesting your website if it can be hacked/bypassed or not. There are multiple methods to bypass it but we&#8217;ll list down easy ones.</p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Pinging\"></span>Pinging<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"></span></h3>\n<p>When you enable Cloudflare on your website, it protects your subdomains and your main domain. However, as default, to avoid any API based issues which are probably in your website, Cloudflare doesn&#8217;t enable its proxy on all sub-domains. You have to manually choose which one has to be enabled. However, newbies on Cloudflare often forget to enable the proxy on their sub-domains which are not in use. Hackers ping those sub-domains and get the real IP. For example, if your website is running on cPanel based panel then it would have the subdomain &#8220;cpanel&#8221; enabled on. If you forget the proxy, it can be pinged and real IP can be found.</p>\n<p><img class=\" wp-image-44 aligncenter\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/shadowhosting.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/commandpromptcloudflare.png?resize=600%2C312&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Bypassing Cloudflare with CMD Prompt\" width=\"600\" height=\"312\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/shadowhosting.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/commandpromptcloudflare.png?resize=300%2C156&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/shadowhosting.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/commandpromptcloudflare.png?resize=768%2C400&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/shadowhosting.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/commandpromptcloudflare.png?resize=945%2C492&amp;ssl=1 945w, https://i2.wp.com/shadowhosting.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/commandpromptcloudflare.png?resize=600%2C313&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i2.wp.com/shadowhosting.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/commandpromptcloudflare.png?w=979&amp;ssl=1 979w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Using_3rd_party_Cloudflare_resolvers\"></span>Using 3rd party Cloudflare resolvers<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"></span></h3>\n<p>There are many Cloudflare resolvers available in the market.

When the hacker triggers the attack, the targeted machine/website is targeted with huge amount of traffic, making it unavailable to respond due to the huge load.</p>\n<p>There are two types of D/DoS attacks.</p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"What_Is_Meant_By_DoS_attack\"></span>What Is Meant By DoS attack?<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"></span></h2>\n<p>DoS stands for Denial of Service attack when the attack is originated from one single computer/machine to the targeted victim. This attack is however weak because of its volume. The attack power may vary depending on the Internet connection or originating computer&#8217;s ability to launch the attack.</p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"How_Do_You_Fight_Against_DoS_attack\"></span>How Do You Fight Against DoS attack?<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"></span></h3>\n<p>Because of its singularity, it is easy to fight against such types of attacks. To do so, one can simply log their machine while an on-going attack, and once the IP address is trapped, it can be blocked when passing through the firewall. So when an attack is originated from blocked IP, the hacker&#8217;s origin computer shows either &#8220;Connection Refused&#8221; or &#8220;Not Responding&#8221; type error and the traffic is not reached to the victim.</p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"What_Is_Meant_By_DDoS_attack\"></span>What Is Meant By DDoS attack?<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"></span></h2>\n<p>DDoS stands for Distributed Denial of Service attack where the attack is originated from multiple computers. By &#8220;multiple computers&#8221;, I mean to say, it can be 2 or more but in some cases, it can be hundreds of thousands of computers attacking one single target at once. Due to its nature, such attacks are mostly very strong and causes service unavailability/lagging because of multiple points of origin. The attack&#8217;s power is usually strong to very strong, depending on the army(computers originating attack)&#8217;s Internet connection or ability(specifications).</p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"How_Do_You_Fight_Against_DDoS_attack\"></span>How Do You Fight Against DDoS attack?<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"></span></h3>\n<p>Because of its multiple points of origin, the attack is very strong. There are usually millions of IP addresses involved in such attacks when launched on a massive scale. The majority of times, the computers/servers involved in the attack are infected. To prevent being infection removed, hackers usually take a very small amount of bandwidth from the infected computer(varying from 1-2 Mbps) which makes it undoubtful for the computer/server user. Due to such nature, it is mostly quite difficult to block such an attack due to its bandwidth transfer and the number of IP addresses involved.</p>\n<p>However, smart firewalls such as Arbor and etc may help in such a scenario where IP addresses are checked for their reputations immediately when requested to enter and if the IP address is involved in the previous attack, then it&#8217;s access to the victim is denied. Another method could be the type of traffic being originated. The firewall checks for the browser and checks if it is a real human accessing the site or a bot trying to take it down. It could be done by checking the request header by putting up CAPTCHA that could be solved only by humans.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Conclusion\"></span>Conclusion<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"></span></h2>\n<p>If you want to get your website protected against such attacks, you might be searching for firewalls.

You may have come across agencies offering SEO services to businesses. What actually does it mean? SEO stands for <strong>Search Engine Optimization</strong>. It is a term in the digital world which means optimizing your rank on Google from down position to the first position.</p>\n<p>When you search for a certain keyword, it shows you up dozens of website&#8217;s links and easy website&#8217;s position defines its rank. Which one would you prefer to choose? Obviously, the first one because you&#8217;re too lazy to go for the second one for no reason. Your website&#8217;s rank defines your average SEO score(with multiple keywords that you&#8217;re ranking for).</p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Factors_Contributing_To_Your_SEO_Score\"></span>Factors Contributing To Your SEO Score<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"></span></h2>\n<p>Now as you already know about SEO, you&#8217;d definitely want to increase your score because the higher the rank you are, the more visitors you&#8217;d get and the more visitors you have, the more conversion/sales you&#8217;ll have. Now we&#8217;ll see which are the most common factors that contribute your SEO&#8217;s rank in search engines.</p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Content_Is_King\"></span>Content Is King<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"></span></h3>\n<p><img class=\" wp-image-156 aligncenter\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/shadowhosting.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/cms.jpg?resize=531%2C354&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Content Management System\" width=\"531\" height=\"354\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/shadowhosting.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/cms.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/shadowhosting.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/cms.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/shadowhosting.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/cms.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/shadowhosting.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/cms.jpg?w=1920&amp;ssl=1 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 531px) 100vw, 531px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<p>It is far proven that content is king because the more content you have on your website, Google finds it more effective to be rankable. But this doesn&#8217;t mean you&#8217;ll just keep writing and exceed 5,000+ words in a single word. No, this wouldn&#8217;t be relevant and Google is aware of this. So whatever you write, write it long enough to make it meaningful.</p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Fame\"></span>Fame<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"></span></h3>\n<p>It is well obvious that Google would prefer to rank popular websites than that of new websites with almost everything new. Now it&#8217;s quite discouraging, right? Nothing much to be disappointed. How do we get famous? The fame is decided by user engagement on your website. How do you get engagement out of your followers? Write something that is worth reading. It should be attractive according to your fan&#8217;s interest. You can analyze your follower&#8217;s interest by viewing the number of your post&#8217;s likes and which content is liked by your audience the most.</p>\n<p><img class=\" wp-image-157 aligncenter\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/shadowhosting.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/fame.jpg?resize=534%2C356&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"534\" height=\"356\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/shadowhosting.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/fame.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/shadowhosting.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/fame.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/shadowhosting.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/fame.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/shadowhosting.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/fame.jpg?w=1920&amp;ssl=1 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 534px) 100vw, 534px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<p>Now if you write something about their interest, they&#8217;d be interested in it and would more likely to share the content. Now if people share, their friends/followers would read and they&#8217;d share too if interested. And if you&#8217;re lucky and your content is worthy enough, you can even get viral.

But are they really best? Do they worth your buck? Probably not. I mean, not all. Majority of the new web hosting providers now has been using reseller hosting to provide &#8220;best&#8221;(so-called tagline) web hosting by spamming people&#8217;s post in the comment section with website link. I sometimes wonder why haven&#8217;t Facebook blacklisted their websites yet? They&#8217;re spamming too much!</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m not saying to not purchase from resellers, however, majority of resellers aren&#8217;t really something you should look out for. Most of them don&#8217;t know how things work. But there are some providers out there providing web hosting services than that of their upstream provider(reseller hosting provider) because they know what they&#8217;re doing. Majority of new web hosting providers just follow up YouTube tutorials and setup a web hosting. To ease your findings, today we&#8217;re going to learn how to find a perfect web hosting provider to fulfill your needs for your website.</p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Factors_To_Consider_Before_Choosing_A_Provider_For_Your_Website\"></span>Factors To Consider Before Choosing A Provider For Your Website<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"></span></h2>\n<p>We&#8217;ll list it down properly so that you can relate it properly as per your needs.</p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Type_Of_Website_You%E2%80%99re_Hosting\"></span>Type Of Website You&#8217;re Hosting<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"></span></h3>\n<p>If you&#8217;re hosting a blog website, then it&#8217;s okay to go for a standard web hosting plan. But if you&#8217;re hosting a blog having huge amount of traffic with complex theme which requires huge CPU resources, you might want to consider for a VPS or a web hosting provider offering you &#8220;dedicated resources&#8221;.</p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Content_Of_Your_Website\"></span>Content Of Your Website<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"></span></h3>\n<p><img class=\" wp-image-149 aligncenter\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/shadowhosting.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/photograph.jpg?resize=574%2C381&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Photograph do depend on website's resources.\" width=\"574\" height=\"381\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/shadowhosting.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/photograph.jpg?resize=300%2C199&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/shadowhosting.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/photograph.jpg?resize=768%2C508&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/shadowhosting.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/photograph.jpg?resize=1024%2C678&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/shadowhosting.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/photograph.jpg?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 574px) 100vw, 574px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<p>Content does matter when you host. No, I&#8217;m not talking about texts. To explain it in a better way, let&#8217;s take an example. Let&#8217;s say you&#8217;re a photographer and loves to take photographs. You&#8217;re tired of sharing it on social media because you&#8217;re not really generating revenue. You now plan to start a website and want to share your photographs to the world. Seems simple, right? No. If you&#8217;re planning to host a &#8220;photographic website&#8221;, make sure you select a web hosting provider that offers you a huge amount of bandwidth, space and CPU power. These resources are used when a visitor visits your website and the server processes the content(photos). When many visitors visit your website, you&#8217;ll have to make sure that your hosting account isn&#8217;t overloaded and your hosting provider doesn&#8217;t suspend you because when you cross your limits, you&#8217;re more likely to get suspended.</p>\n<p>So consider for a provider having enough bandwidth, space and CPU power.</p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Running_An_IP_Blacklist_Checkup\"></span>Running An IP Blacklist Checkup<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"></span></h3>\n<p>This is one of the most important factors you may want to look for. As we all know, web hosting means that you are being hosted on a server where many other websites are hosted on the same. A single IPv4 is assigned to many websites. So in case any of their websites are involved in spamming activities, the provider&#8217;s IP would get blacklisted. Many hosting providers tend to ignore this and later on, it results in many complications when sending emails via the hosting. When an IP address is blacklisted, it can result in your website&#8217;s email/business email(eg name@example.com) getting landed into spam/junk box.</p>\n<p>To prevent this, make sure you contact the provider and ask for the IP address. You can then check for it&#8217;s IP reputation using <a href=\"https://mxtoolbox.com/blacklists.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">MXToolbox IP Blacklist Checker</a>.</p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Reasonable_Price\"></span>Reasonable Price<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"></span></h3>\n<p>Before purchasing hosting service, make sure you check for their price. The price should be reasonable. Don&#8217;t go and purchase hosting from someone offering you &#8220;5 GB SSD, 100 GB Bandwidth, 2 FTP accounts&#8221; for $10/month. And don&#8217;t even go for super cheap i.e $12 for a whole damn year! Make it reasonable as per the resource is being offered to you.</p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Review\"></span>Review<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"></span></h3>\n<p><img class=\"wp-image-150  aligncenter\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/shadowhosting.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/internet.jpg?resize=595%2C335&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Reviews\" width=\"595\" height=\"335\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/shadowhosting.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/internet.jpg?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/shadowhosting.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/internet.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/shadowhosting.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/internet.jpg?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/shadowhosting.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/internet.jpg?resize=678%2C381&amp;ssl=1 678w, https://i0.wp.com/shadowhosting.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/internet.jpg?w=1920&amp;ssl=1 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 595px) 100vw, 595px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<p>Last but not least, reviews! The biggest factor. Make sure you run a thorough Google check against the provider and search for critics more than &#8220;positivity&#8221; because &#8220;5 stars&#8221; are many times fake reviews posted by the provider itself. Critics are more likely to be true due to obvious reasons.</p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Age\"></span>Age<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"></span></h3>\n<p>It isn&#8217;t much to be considered but to be taken note of. Try not to purchase a whole year hosting service from hosting providers who are new to the industry. You can simply check it by going to whois website and writing their domain name and checking when the domain name was registered. To check whois, simply go to whois.com/whois/yourdomainname.com (replace yourdomainname.com the provider&#8217;s domain name) and search for it.</p>\n<p>There are many other factors that are to be considered before selecting one. I&#8217;ve mentioned above most obvious ones for a newbie to consider. You can also invest your own logic before purchasing :).</p>\n<hr />\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Conclusion\"></span>Conclusion<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"></span></h2>\n<p>Coming to the conclusion, we&#8217;ve mentioned most of the factors that are to be taken into consideration before choosing a hosting provider for your web hosting.

So let&#8217;s begin installing LAMP Stack on your VPS.</p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Installing_LAMP_Stack_on_CentOS_7\"></span>Installing LAMP Stack on CentOS 7<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"></span></h2>\n<p>Starting with the first step, we have to connect to your VPS using SSH client, Putty(if you&#8217;re using Windows).</p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Step_1_%E2%80%93_Updating_system_packages_to_the_latest_version\"></span>Step 1 &#8211; Updating system packages to the latest version<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"></span></h3>\n<p>Before you install the applications, make sure your CentOs 7 server is up to date by running the command below:</p>\n<div class=\"EnlighterJSWrapper enlighterEnlighterJSWrapper\">\n<pre>sudo yum update</pre>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Step_2_%E2%80%93_Installing_%E2%80%9CA%E2%80%9Dpache_or_Apache_on_the_system_and_installing_essential_tools_needed\"></span>Step 2 &#8211; Installing &#8220;A&#8221;pache or Apache on the system and installing essential tools needed<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"></span></h3>\n<p>We&#8217;re going to use Yum package manager to install Apache on your VPS. To install, use the command below:</p>\n<pre>sudo yum install httpd wget nano</pre>\n<p>Now after installation, we have to turn on the Apache to test if it is working well. To do so, make sure your port 80 is enabled. To see if it is working, copy your VPS&#8217;s IP and paste it in the web browser and visit the IP. If you see the page like displayed below, it means it is working well!</p>\n<p><img class=\" wp-image-71 aligncenter\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/shadowhosting.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/httpd-test-page.png?resize=580%2C286&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"HTTPD Test Page - LAMP Stack\" width=\"580\" height=\"286\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/shadowhosting.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/httpd-test-page.png?resize=300%2C148&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/shadowhosting.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/httpd-test-page.png?resize=768%2C379&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/shadowhosting.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/httpd-test-page.png?resize=1024%2C506&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/shadowhosting.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/httpd-test-page.png?w=1899&amp;ssl=1 1899w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<p>Now to enable the Apache service on boot use the command below:</p>\n<p><strong>systemctl enable httpd.service</strong></p>\n<p>Now whenever your server reboots, Apache will be started at the boot so you don&#8217;t have to always connect to your VPS and turn it on after every restart. This will be more beneficial if you&#8217;re running a test environment where you require a lot of reboots.</p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Step_3_%E2%80%93_Installing_MariaDB\"></span>Step 3 &#8211; Installing MariaDB<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"></span></h3>\n<p>Now it&#8217;s time to install the database management system MariaDB on your VPS. To do that, we&#8217;ll use the Yum package manager once again. To do so, use the command below:</p>\n<pre>sudo yum install mariadb-server mariadb</pre>\n<p>Confirm the installation by pressing Y and enter/return button.</p>\n<p>Now since MariaDB is installed on your system, we will turn it on. To do that, use the command mentioned below:</p>\n<pre>systemctl start mariadb</pre>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Step_4_%E2%80%93_Securing_MariaDB\"></span>Step 4 &#8211; Securing MariaDB<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"></span></h3>\n<p>By default, MariaDB isn&#8217;t secure because of the anonymous user is enabled on installation and the password is not yet set up. To begin setting up the installation, use the command mentioned below:</p>\n<pre>sudo mysql_secure_installation</pre>\n<p>You will be prompted to enter your MariaDB password. Since we&#8217;re doing a fresh installation, we do not need to enter the MariaDB password. Just press Enter to continue. Now you will be asked if you want to set up MariaDB admin/root password. For security reason, you should press &#8220;Y&#8221; and then press Enter to set the password. Do not confuse between your MariaDB password and your server&#8217;s root password. They both are different.</p>\n<p>For your easy, we have written down questions that will be asked to you with answers you&#8217;ve to insert accordingly.</p>\n<ol class=\"hoverEnabled enlighterEnlighterJS EnlighterJS\">\n<li class=\" odd\"><span class=\"\">Set root password? </span><span class=\"br0\">[</span><span class=\"\">Y/n</span><span class=\"br0\">]</span><span class=\"\"> Y</span></li>\n<li class=\" even\"><span class=\"\">New password: Enter your password here</span></li>\n<li class=\" odd\"><span class=\"\">Re-enter new password: repeat your password</span></li>\n<li class=\" even\"><span class=\"\">Remove anonymous users? </span><span class=\"br0\">[</span><span class=\"\">Y/n</span><span class=\"br0\">]</span><span class=\"\"> Y</span></li>\n<li class=\" odd\"><span class=\"\">Disallow root login remotely? </span><span class=\"br0\">[</span><span class=\"\">Y/n</span><span class=\"br0\">]</span><span class=\"\"> Y</span></li>\n<li class=\" even\"><span class=\"\">Remove test database and access to it? </span><span class=\"br0\">[</span><span class=\"\">Y/n</span><span class=\"br0\">]</span><span class=\"\"> Y</span></li>\n<li class=\" odd\"><span class=\"\">Reload privilege tables now? </span><span class=\"br0\">[</span><span class=\"\">Y/n</span><span class=\"br0\">]</span><span class=\"\"> Y</span></li>\n</ol>\n<p>At the last after every setup of MariaDB, you will see the below-written message which means it is installed correctly</p>\n<pre>.... Success!\r\nCleaning up...</pre>\n<p>All done! If you&#8217;ve completed all of the above steps, your MariaDB installation should now be secure.</p>\n<p>Everything is set up for MariaDB. Now we&#8217;ll have to enable it for boot. To do that, we will use the below-mentioned command:</p>\n<pre>sudo systemctl enable mariadb.service</pre>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Step_5_%E2%80%93_Installing_PHP\"></span>Step 5 &#8211; Installing PHP<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"></span></h3>\n<p>PHP is one of the most used web programming languages on the Internet. It is a server-side web page programming language which works well with HTML and other basic web languages. It is also used to integrate the web page with MariaDB server to store data from your web page to the database and to even fetch it. So let&#8217;s begin installing PHP on your CentOS 7 server.</p>\n<p>To install PHP 5.6, we need to install EPEL Release and Remi repository. Along with that, we need few more things to allow PHP 5.6 installation to take place. To do that, use below-mentioned commands.</p>\n<pre>yum install https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm\r\nyum install http://rpms.remirepo.net/enterprise/remi-release-7.rpm\r\nyum-config-manager --enable remi-php56\r\n</pre>\n<p>So let&#8217;s install PHP and it&#8217;s MySQL extension. To do that, use the command mentioned below:</p>\n<pre>yum install php php-mcrypt php-cli php-gd php-curl php-mysql php-ldap php-zip php-fileinfo\r\n</pre>\n<p>Confirm the installation process by pressing <strong>Y</strong> and then <strong>Enter</strong> button.</p>\n<p>Now since we&#8217;ve installed PHP, we will have to make it go in effect with the webserver. To do that, we would have to reboot. Use the command mentioned below to reboot your web server Apache.</p>\n<pre>sudo systemctl restart httpd.service</pre>\n<p>Now PHP is installed on the webserver.</p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Testing_PHP\"></span>Testing PHP<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"></span></h3>\n<p>Now even PHP is installed. Let&#8217;s test if it is working properly. To do that, you have to write the commands mentioned below:</p>\n<pre>cd /var/www/html</pre>\n<p>Now we&#8217;re in the public directory where your website&#8217;s file is updated. The command &#8220;cd&#8221; is used to navigate to the directory you wanted to visit ie &#8220;/var/www/html&#8221;. Now we will have to make a test PHP file to see if it is working properly through a web browser. To do that, we would need a command-line text editor. Since we&#8217;ve already installed &#8220;nano&#8221; in the first step, we will directly use it to make a new file. We will name the file as &#8220;test.php&#8221;.</p>\n<pre>nano test.php</pre>\n<p>Now paste the code as mentioned below.</p>\n<pre>&lt;?php\r\nphpinfo();\r\n?&gt;</pre>\n<p>The above code is a parameter in PHP used to check all modules and everything in detail about the current PHP installation in your server. To save the file, press &#8220;CTRL + X&#8221; and press Y and then Enter to save it.</p>\n<p>To test if it is working, copy the IP address of the server and enter it into the browser. You will see something like below on the screen. If you see so, it works well and everything went fine.</p>\n<p><img class=\" wp-image-74 aligncenter\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/shadowhosting.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/test.php_.png?resize=516%2C707&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Testing PHP - Installing LAMP\" width=\"516\" height=\"707\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/shadowhosting.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/test.php_.png?resize=219%2C300&amp;ssl=1 219w, https://i1.wp.com/shadowhosting.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/test.php_.png?w=635&amp;ssl=1 635w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 516px) 100vw, 516px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<p>Now it is showing all PHP information.

        "content": "<p>MariaDB is a database management system made to allow developers to run queries and manage their database and their data. It can be accessed through a different port on the network(which is usually 3306) and to get into it, one requires a strong password for it&#8217;s &#8220;root&#8221; username. While choosing a strong password, one can usually forget it because a strong password contains a combination of symbols, capital letters, small letters, and numbers. While forgetting password can be a big deal, we need to find a way to reset it.

To do so, we&#8217;ll use the <a href=\"https://shadowhosting.net/blog/connecting-vps-using-putty/\">SSH client, Putty</a>. Once we&#8217;re logging in, we&#8217;ll begin with resetting the password.</p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Step_1_%E2%80%93_Stopping_the_MariaDB_server\"></span>Step 1 &#8211; Stopping the MariaDB server<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"></span></h3>\n<p>To reset the password, we&#8217;ll need to first stop the MariaDB server.

But without password, we can&#8217;t&#8230; Or, can we? Yes, we can. To do so, we&#8217;ll need to enable the MariaDB server&#8217;s safe mode. Use the following command to enter into safe mode.</p>\n<pre>mysqld_safe --skip-grant-tables &amp;</pre>\n<p>So now we&#8217;re in safe mode. We&#8217;ll log in to the server. To do so, we&#8217;ll directly login without user password.

We&#8217;ll need to access the database. Use the following command to access the database.</p>\n<pre>USE mysql;\r\n</pre>\n<p>Before we begin resetting, we&#8217;ll need to flush the privileges to avoid errors like &#8220;insecure execution&#8221;. To do so, use the following command.</p>\n<pre>FLUSH PRIVILEGES;</pre>\n<p>Now <strong>it&#8217;s time to reset the MariaDB root password</strong>. Use the below-mentioned command to do so.</p>\n<pre>UPDATE USER SET PASSWORD=PASSWORD(\"newpasswordhere\") WHERE USER='root';</pre>\n<p>Where &#8220;newpasswordhere&#8221; will be the new password you&#8217;d like to set for the username root.

        "content": "<p>Many times when we&#8217;re migrating our hosting providers or platforms, we occur problems to import the database in the new host&#8217;s database. This is because of the import size limit that is imposed by default. This can be limited to 10 MB, 20 MB or sometimes even 2 MB. Mostly in VPS or Linux servers.</p>\n<p>In this article, we&#8217;re going to learn how to increase the import size limit of phpMyAdmin on a CentOS 7 machine.

So let&#8217;s begin increasing the upload limit.</p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Increase_Import_Size_Limit_of_phpMyAdmin\"></span>Increase Import Size Limit of phpMyAdmin<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"></span></h2>\n<p>The limit is imposed by PHP settings on your server which means it has nothing to do with phpMyAdmin configurations. To increase the limit, we have to edit the PHP configuration which lies in &#8220;php.ini&#8221;. Whatever we do, we should do it precautiously because doing anything wrong can result in getting the whole PHP broken.</p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Editing_PHP_ini\"></span>Editing PHP.ini<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"></span></h3>\n<p>To edit PHP.ini, we need to find where actually it exists. Generally, people use Apache so we&#8217;d consider Apache in this article. The &#8220;php.ini&#8221; is located inside /etc directory. So we&#8217;d use the nano text editor to edit the file. Use the below-mentioned command to find the php.ini file properly.</p>\n<pre>nano /etc/php.ini</pre>\n<p>Now there would be a bunch of codes you&#8217;d see on your screen. Scroll down by pressing down arrow button till you find any one of these three lines because we&#8217;ve to edit them.</p>\n<pre>memorylimit\r\npostmaxsize\r\nuploadmaxfilesize\r\n</pre>\n<p>Since we&#8217;re upgrading the limit, we&#8217;d keep it at a moderate level of 128 MB. So to do so, replace old values of above-mentioned defines and put it as desired(recommended 128 MB unless you&#8217;re trying to upload big files).</p>\n<pre>memory_limit = 128M\r\n\r\npost_max_size = 128M\r\n\r\nupload_max_filesize = 122M\r\n</pre>\n<p>Once done, press CTRL + X and then press Y and then Enter button to save the changes we&#8217;ve made. To make them work in effect, we need to restart Apache. To do so, use the following command.</p>\n<pre>service httpd restart</pre>\n<p><strong>We&#8217;re done!</strong> You can now see the limits are increased to what we&#8217;ve set(128 MB for this article).

To connect to a SAMP server over the Internet, there should be a server which needs to have an active Internet connection to allow players to connect from multiple computers from all over the world.</p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"How_To_Install_SAMP_Server_on_CentOS_7_VPS/Dedicated_Server\"></span>How To Install SAMP Server on CentOS 7 VPS/Dedicated Server?<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"></span></h2>\n<p>In this article, we&#8217;re going to learn how to install a SAMP server on a CentOS 7 machine. To connect to the machine, one should have SSH client, Putty installed in order, to begin with. If you don&#8217;t know how to connect to VPS, refer to <a href=\"https://shadowhosting.net/blog/connecting-vps-using-putty/\">this article</a> for proper instructions on connecting to a VPS.</p>\n<p>We will be installing SAMP on the machine with multiple steps. So once you&#8217;ve connected to the machine, use the following steps to begin installing.</p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Step_1_%E2%80%93_Installing_Updating_Required_packages_for_SAMP_Server\"></span>Step 1 &#8211; Installing &amp; Updating Required packages for SAMP Server<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"></span></h3>\n<p>There are a few packages that are required to be installed on the machine. Use the below-mentioned commands to install and update the services. Some packages are included which we would need to configure the server later.</p>\n<pre>yum update\r\nsudo yum install nano libstdc++.so.6 wget -y \r\n</pre>\n<p>When updating, press Y button and then Enter to confirm installing updates for your packages using Yum package manager.</p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Step_2_%E2%80%93_Downloading_extracting_the_latest_SAMP_server_package_from_SAMP_website\"></span>Step 2 &#8211; Downloading &amp; extracting the latest SAMP server package from SAMP website<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"></span></h3>\n<p>Now it&#8217;s time to install the latest SAMP server package from official SAMP website. To do that, use the following command.</p>\n<pre>wget http://files.sa-mp.com/samp037svr_R2-1.tar.gz</pre>\n<p>This will automatically download the package. As you can see, the file ends with a &#8220;.tar.gz&#8221; extension, it means it is compressed. To decompress, we need to use this command.</p>\n<pre>tar -zxf samp037svr_R2-1.tar.gz</pre>\n<p>With the command, the file will be decompressed and a new file named &#8220;samp03&#8221; will appear. We will need to configure it.</p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Step_3_%E2%80%93_Configuring_your_server_package\"></span>Step 3 &#8211; Configuring your server package<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"></span></h3>\n<p>To configure the package we&#8217;ve downloaded, we need to follow this step. First of all, we need to access the newly created folder after decompressing the package we&#8217;ve downloaded. To access, use &#8220;cd&#8221; command.</p>\n<pre>cd samp03</pre>\n<p>Now since we&#8217;re inside the SAMP package directory, you may want to see which files are there. To do that, use this command.</p>\n<pre>ls</pre>\n<p>After that, you&#8217;ll see the list of files in the directory. By default, the SAMP server will not start unless we change its RCON password from &#8220;changeme&#8217; to something else. To do that, we need to edit and configure the <em>server.cfg</em> file. Use the below-mentioned command to access the server.cfg file.</p>\n<pre>nano server.cfg</pre>\n<p>You will see the list of configuration that is awaiting to be changed. You will see something like this.</p>\n<pre>echo Executing Server Config...\r\nlanmode 0\r\nrcon_password changeme\r\nmaxplayers 50\r\nport 7777\r\nhostname SA-MP 0.3 Server\r\ngamemode0 grandlarc 1\r\nfilterscripts base gl_actions gl_property gl_realtime\r\nannounce 0\r\nquery 1\r\nweburl www.sa-mp.com\r\nmaxnpc 0\r\nonfoot_rate 40\r\nincar_rate 40\r\nweapon_rate 40\r\nstream_distance 300.0\r\nstream_rate 1000\r\n</pre>\n<p>Now scroll your edit pointer to &#8220;rcon_password&#8221; and remove changeme and add your desired password. Make sure the password doesn&#8217;t contain any spaces in it. Max players can be defined to set the maximum number of players connected to the server(max limited by SAMP is 1000). Gamemode0 is the script you will upload to provide in-game features to your players and filterscript acts like plugins. &#8220;announce&#8221; means whether to allow the server to be displayed in &#8220;Internet&#8221; tab or no, it&#8217;s boolean so 1 means yes and 0 means no. The query as it is and for weburl set the website URL of your SAMP server.</p>\n<p>You don&#8217;t really have to edit it all unless you want to, but just make sure you edit the &#8220;rcon_password changeme&#8221; to &#8220;rcon_password somethingelse&#8221; where &#8220;somethingelse&#8221; is your RCON password which can be used to access your server remotely.</p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Step_4_%E2%80%93_Setting_files_permission\"></span>Step 4 &#8211; Setting files permission<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"></span></h3>\n<p>Sometimes files downloaded from SAMP website are locked due to its pre-configuration that came along with the files. To unlock the file and make it accessible, use the following command to set proper permissions for all the files in the &#8220;samp03&#8221; directory.</p>\n<pre>chmod +x *\r\n</pre>\n<p>Now your SAMP server is configured. It&#8217;s time to try on with the server.</p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Step_5_%E2%80%93_Starting_the_server\"></span>Step 5 &#8211; Starting the server<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"></span></h3>\n<p>To test if the server is working fine, you need to start it. To start, use the following command to execute the start file &#8220;samp03svr&#8221;.</p>\n<pre>./samp03svr</pre>\n<p>Now your server is started. Use your machine&#8217;s hostname or IP and paste it in your SAMP client&#8217;s favorite. You will see your server running. But what happens when you close the Putty? Well, the server closes too. But why? It is because we&#8217;ve just executed and we need to keep it alive even after we close Putty. To do that, we will use the nohup command. Use the following command to do that.</p>\n<pre>nohup ./samp03svr</pre>\n<p>You will see something like this.</p>\n<pre>[root@bot samp03]# nohup ./samp03svr\r\nnohup: ignoring input and appending output to \u2018nohup.out\u2019\r\n</pre>\n<p>It means the server has started and will work even after you close your Putty.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Start_Your_Own_SAMP_Server_With_Shadow_Hosting!\"></span>Start Your Own SAMP Server With Shadow Hosting!<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"></span></h2>\n<p>Planning to start your own SAMP server?

Let\u2019s see what a panel is.</p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"OGP_Panel\"></span><span id=\"OGP_Panel\" class=\"ez-toc-section\">OGP Panel</span><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"></span></h3>\n<p>OGP Panel is a web GUI which is used to manage the games hosted on a particular server. It consists of \u201cStart\u201d, \u201cStop\u201d, \u201cRestart\u201d and other necessary buttons required to operate a game server without logging into SSH of the server. In simple words, it is a web application, a collection of PHP files and MySQL database. It is useless without a remote server, ie, an agent.</p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"OGP_Agent\"></span><span id=\"OGP_Agent\" class=\"ez-toc-section\">OGP Agent</span><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"></span></h3>\n<p>As mentioned above, the OGP Panel is useless without a remote server, aka, an agent. OGP Agent is a remote/local server which is where the games are hosted. The panel first connects to the agent and then the panel operator can make a game server. When an action/operation is executed through the panel, the panel sends a request to the agent and that is where it is processed.</p>\n<p>In this article, we&#8217;re gonna learn how to install OGP Panel on a fresh CentOS 7 VPS/dedicated server. Before we begin, let&#8217;s take a look at system requirements.</p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"System_Requirements\"></span><span id=\"System_Requirements\" class=\"ez-toc-section\">System Requirements</span><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"></span></h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Minimum 512 MB RAM</li>\n<li>4 GB minimum disk space</li>\n<li>At least 1 vCore/Core</li>\n<li>CentOS 7 OS(For this tutorial, we\u2019ll be using CentOS 7.

If you don\u2019t know how to, read this article to know\u00a0<a href=\"https://shadowhosting.net/blog/connecting-vps-using-putty/\">how to connect to a VPS using Putty</a>.</p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Step_1_%E2%80%93_Installing_required_packages\"></span>Step 1 &#8211; Installing required packages.<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"></span></h3>\n<p>In the first step, we&#8217;re going to install required packages for OGP Panel. This will include EPEL packages and other necessary ones. To install them, copy and paste the below-mentioned commands in your SSH client, Putty. These packages will include MariaDB in it.</p>\n<pre>sudo yum -y install epel-release wget subversion git mariadb-server</pre>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Step_2_%E2%80%93_Configuring_MariaDB_Server_Securing_it\"></span>Step 2 &#8211; Configuring MariaDB Server &amp; Securing it<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"></span></h3>\n<p>In step 1, we installed packages along with MariaDB&#8217;s server package. It&#8217;s time to configure it via the below-mentioned command. It will ask you to configure it accordingly and you have to follow the steps.</p>\n<pre>service mariadb start\r\nmysql_secure_installation</pre>\n<p>We&#8217;ve written down the steps and you&#8217;ll have to confirm and deny accordingly for the best security and configuration. Please do not do it on your own unless you know what you&#8217;re dealing up with. Make sure you remember your MariaDB root password as it will be required later in further steps.</p>\n<pre>Set root password? [Y/n] Y\r\nNew password: Enter your password here\r\nRe-enter new password: repeat your password\r\nRemove anonymous users? [Y/n] Y\r\nDisallow root login remotely? [Y/n] Y\r\nRemove test database and access to it? [Y/n] Y\r\nReload privilege tables now? [Y/n] Y</pre>\n<p>After confirming this, you will see something like the below. If it shows how it is, we&#8217;ve successfully configured MariaDB.</p>\n<pre>\u2026. Success!\r\nCleaning up\u2026\r\nAll done! If you\u2019ve completed all of the above steps, your MariaDB installation should now be secure.</pre>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Step_3_%E2%80%93_Installing_OGP_Panel_packages_Installing_it\"></span>Step 3 &#8211; Installing OGP Panel packages &amp; Installing it<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"></span></h3>\n<p>We&#8217;ve successfully configured our machine, to begin with, the installation process. It&#8217;s time to install the OGP panel by downloading it and installing it. To do so, use the below-mentioned command:</p>\n<pre>wget -N \"https://github.com/OpenGamePanel/Easy-Installers/raw/master/Linux/CentOS/ogp_panel_rpm-1.0.0-1.noarch.rpm\" -O \"ogp_panel.rpm\"\r\nsudo yum -y install \"ogp_panel.rpm\"\r\n</pre>\n<p>Be patience! It may take up to 5 to 10 minutes or maybe less or maybe more, depending on your server&#8217;s speed.</p>\n<h4><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Configuring_OGP_Panel_by_connecting_it_with_MariaDB\"></span>Configuring OGP Panel by connecting it with MariaDB<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"></span></h4>\n<p>Now it&#8217;s time to connect OGP Panel by connecting it to MariaDB server which we&#8217;ve configured it in 2nd step.</p>\n<pre>sudo bash /var/www/html/create_db.sh\r\n</pre>\n<p>Enter the password that you&#8217;ve set in while configuring MariaDB in step 2. Press enter after setting up the password. You will see the credentials containing the MySQL details. It will look something like this.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_102\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-102\" style=\"width: 629px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-102\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/shadowhosting.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/ogp-panel-mysql.png?resize=629%2C170&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"After setting up MySQL Database\" width=\"629\" height=\"170\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/shadowhosting.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/ogp-panel-mysql.png?resize=300%2C81&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/shadowhosting.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/ogp-panel-mysql.png?w=645&amp;ssl=1 645w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 629px) 100vw, 629px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-102\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">OGP Installation based credential, only for article purpose.</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Since we&#8217;ve completely configured OGP by creating a database, it&#8217;s time to set up the web-based GUI. But before we proceed, we need to restart our system or else we&#8217;d face problems proceed further. To restart your CentOS 7 machine immediately, use the below-mentioned command:</p>\n<pre>sudo shutdown -r now\r\n</pre>\n<p>We&#8217;ve configured it successfully. It&#8217;s time to set up the web-based GUI.</p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Step_4_%E2%80%93_Configuring_OGP_Panel_page_Creating_an_Admin_user_account\"></span>Step 4 &#8211; Configuring OGP Panel page &amp; Creating an Admin user account.<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"></span></h3>\n<p>In this step, we will no longer need to proceed with command lines. We now have to configure the website with the credentials we&#8217;ve obtained from OGP installation. To do that, copy your server&#8217;s hostname or IP address and paste it in your browser&#8217;s URL box and press Enter.</p>\n<pre>http://your.server.ip.address</pre>\n<p>You will see something like this.</p>\n<p><img class=\" wp-image-103 aligncenter\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/shadowhosting.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/ogp-panel-install-begin.png?resize=555%2C663&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"OGP Panel Installation first step\" width=\"555\" height=\"663\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/shadowhosting.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/ogp-panel-install-begin.png?resize=251%2C300&amp;ssl=1 251w, https://i0.wp.com/shadowhosting.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/ogp-panel-install-begin.png?w=691&amp;ssl=1 691w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 555px) 100vw, 555px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<p>As shown in the above pic, everything should be ticked &#8220;OK&#8221; &amp; &#8220;Found&#8221; so that we can proceed further.

It means you&#8217;ve configured OGP Panel with MariaDB successfully. Now start configuring the administrator credentials. Due to some reasons, OGP has disabled putting symbols in the passwords so choose wisely without including symbols in passwords. It will look something like this.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_106\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-106\" style=\"width: 547px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-106 \" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/shadowhosting.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/ogp-admin-login-details.png?resize=547%2C297&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"OGP Administrator Login Details\" width=\"547\" height=\"297\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/shadowhosting.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/ogp-admin-login-details.png?resize=300%2C163&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/shadowhosting.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/ogp-admin-login-details.png?w=685&amp;ssl=1 685w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 547px) 100vw, 547px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-106\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">These details are ONLY for article purpose.</figcaption></figure>\n<p>As soon as you press the &#8220;Next&#8221; button, you will find out that you&#8217;ve successfully installed OGP on your server. Hurrah! We did it! But wait? Did we really &#8220;complete&#8221; the installation? No, not yet. It seems like we&#8217;ve completed the installation but we haven&#8217;t connected the <a href=\"https://shadowhosting.net/blog/install-ogp-agent-on-centos-7/\">OGP agent</a> and OGP panel yet. To do that, let&#8217;s follow the last steps before we&#8217;ve good to go.</p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Connecting_OGP_Agent_with_OGP_Panel\"></span>Connecting OGP Agent with OGP Panel<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"></span></h2>\n<p>It&#8217;s time to connect the agent server with the panel. To do so, you have to log in to your OGP panel and go to Administration &gt; Servers or simply replace the IP/hostname with the URL mentioned below and proceed. You must have an <a href=\"https://shadowhosting.net/blog/install-ogp-agent-on-centos-7\">OGP agent installed</a> before you proceed!</p>\n<pre>http://your.server.ip.address/home.php?m=server\r\n</pre>\n<p>Now it&#8217;s time to enter the agent credentials to the panel so that it can be connected and ready to use. In the &#8220;Remote Host&#8221; section, enter your OGP agent&#8217;s IP address. When you navigate to the next section, other sections will be automatically filled as they should be. In the &#8220;hostname&#8221; section, again enter the IP or the hostname. For the encryption key, you need to go to <a href=\"https://shadowhosting.net/blog/install-ogp-agent-on-centos-7/#Step_2_Downloading_and_Installing_OGP_Agent_files\">step 2 of the OGP agent installation article</a> and write the command and check the encryption key.

Let&#8217;s see what are those.</p>\n<div id=\"ez-toc-container\" class=\"ez-toc-v2_0_11 counter-hierarchy counter-decimal ez-toc-grey\">\n<div class=\"ez-toc-title-container\">\n<p class=\"ez-toc-title\">Table of Contents</p>\n<span class=\"ez-toc-title-toggle\"><a class=\"ez-toc-pull-right ez-toc-btn ez-toc-btn-xs ez-toc-btn-default ez-toc-toggle\"><i class=\"ez-toc-glyphicon ez-toc-icon-toggle\"></i></a></span></div>\n<nav><ul class=\"ez-toc-list ez-toc-list-level-1\"><li class=\"ez-toc-page-1 ez-toc-heading-level-2\"><a class=\"ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-1\" href=\"https://shadowhosting.net/blog/install-ogp-agent-on-centos-7/#Open_Game_Panel_Structures\" title=\"Open Game Panel Structures\">Open Game Panel Structures</a><ul class=\"ez-toc-list-level-3\"><li class=\"ez-toc-heading-level-3\"><a class=\"ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-2\" href=\"https://shadowhosting.net/blog/install-ogp-agent-on-centos-7/#OGP_Panel\" title=\"OGP Panel\">OGP Panel</a></li><li class=\"ez-toc-page-1 ez-toc-heading-level-3\"><a class=\"ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-3\" href=\"https://shadowhosting.net/blog/install-ogp-agent-on-centos-7/#OGP_Agent\" title=\"OGP Agent\">OGP Agent</a></li></ul></li><li class=\"ez-toc-page-1 ez-toc-heading-level-2\"><a class=\"ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-4\" href=\"https://shadowhosting.net/blog/install-ogp-agent-on-centos-7/#System_Requirements\" title=\"System Requirements\">System Requirements</a></li><li class=\"ez-toc-page-1 ez-toc-heading-level-2\"><a class=\"ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-5\" href=\"https://shadowhosting.net/blog/install-ogp-agent-on-centos-7/#How_To_Install_OGP_Agent_server_on_a_CentOS_7_machine\" title=\"How To Install OGP Agent server on a CentOS 7 machine\">How To Install OGP Agent server on a CentOS 7 machine</a><ul class=\"ez-toc-list-level-3\"><li class=\"ez-toc-heading-level-3\"><a class=\"ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-6\" href=\"https://shadowhosting.net/blog/install-ogp-agent-on-centos-7/#Step_1_%E2%80%93_Installing_Necessary_Packages\" title=\"Step 1 &#8211; Installing Necessary Packages\">Step 1 &#8211; Installing Necessary Packages</a></li><li class=\"ez-toc-page-1 ez-toc-heading-level-3\"><a class=\"ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-7\" href=\"https://shadowhosting.net/blog/install-ogp-agent-on-centos-7/#Step_2_%E2%80%93_Downloading_and_Installing_OGP_Agent_files\" title=\"Step 2 &#8211; Downloading and Installing OGP Agent files.\">Step 2 &#8211; Downloading and Installing OGP Agent files.</a></li></ul></li><li class=\"ez-toc-page-1 ez-toc-heading-level-2\"><a class=\"ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-8\" href=\"https://shadowhosting.net/blog/install-ogp-agent-on-centos-7/#A_VPS_to_Install_OGP_Agent_on!\" title=\"A VPS to Install OGP Agent on!\">A VPS to Install OGP Agent on!</a></li><li class=\"ez-toc-page-1 ez-toc-heading-level-2\"><a class=\"ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-9\" href=\"https://shadowhosting.net/blog/install-ogp-agent-on-centos-7/#Conclusion\" title=\"Conclusion\">Conclusion</a></li></ul></nav></div>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Open_Game_Panel_Structures\"></span>Open Game Panel Structures<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"></span></h2>\n<p>The OGP panel is divided into two structures, the first one is an agent and the second is a panel. Let&#8217;s see what a panel is.</p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"OGP_Panel\"></span>OGP Panel<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"></span></h3>\n<p>OGP Panel is a web GUI which is used to manage the games hosted on a particular server. It consists of &#8220;Start&#8221;, &#8220;Stop&#8221;, &#8220;Restart&#8221; and other necessary buttons required to operate a game server without logging into SSH of the server. In simple words, it is a web application, a collection of PHP files and MySQL database. It is useless without a remote server, ie, an agent.</p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"OGP_Agent\"></span>OGP Agent<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"></span></h3>\n<p>As mentioned above, the OGP Panel is useless without a remote server, aka, an agent. OGP Agent is a remote/local server which is where the games are hosted. The panel first connects to the agent and then the panel operator can make a game server. When an action/operation is executed through the panel, the panel sends a request to the agent and that is where it is processed.</p>\n<p>In this article, we&#8217;re going to learn how to install OGP agent on a CentOS 7 machine. Before we begin, we will see the system requirements needed to install a complete OGP installation.</p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"System_Requirements\"></span>System Requirements<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"></span></h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Minimum 512 MB RAM</li>\n<li>4 GB minimum disk space</li>\n<li>At least 1 vCore/Core</li>\n<li>CentOS 7 OS(For this tutorial, we&#8217;ll be using CentOS 7. OGP can be installed on other OS too.)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Let&#8217;s begin!</p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"How_To_Install_OGP_Agent_server_on_a_CentOS_7_machine\"></span>How To Install OGP Agent server on a CentOS 7 machine<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"></span></h2>\n<p>Connect to your VPS using SSH client, Putty. If you don&#8217;t know how to, read this article to know <a href=\"https://shadowhosting.net/blog/connecting-vps-using-putty/\">how to connect to a VPS using Putty</a>.</p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Step_1_%E2%80%93_Installing_Necessary_Packages\"></span>Step 1 &#8211; Installing Necessary Packages<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"></span></h3>\n<p>So starting from number one, we&#8217;re going to update the server&#8217;s packages using <a href=\"https://shadowhosting.net/blog/tag/yum-package-manager/\">Yum package manager</a>. Let&#8217;s begin!</p>\n<pre>sudo yum update</pre>\n<p>If it asks for any confirmation, press Y and then hit the Enter button to proceed to update the packages. And when it is done, we&#8217;ll install a few other packages that are needed.</p>\n<pre>sudo yum -y install epel-release wget subversion git\r\nsudo yum install -y perl-HTTP-Daemon perl-LWP-Protocol-http10 proftpd proftpd-utils perl-ExtUtils-MakeMaker glibc.i686 glibc libgcc_s.so.1 perl-IO-Compress-Bzip2</pre>\n<p>Copy and then paste both lines and press Enter. It will begin installing all necessary packages. Since we already had mentioned &#8220;-y&#8221; which means automatically accept all confirmations, it will not ask you for any confirmation to proceed.</p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Step_2_%E2%80%93_Downloading_and_Installing_OGP_Agent_files\"></span>Step 2 &#8211; Downloading and Installing OGP Agent files.<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"></span></h3>\n<p>This will first download the OGP Easy Installer package and name it as per requirement.</p>\n<pre>wget -N \"https://github.com/OpenGamePanel/Easy-Installers/raw/master/Linux/CentOS/ogp_agent_rpm-1.0.0-1.noarch.rpm\" -O \"ogp_agent.rpm\"\r\nsudo yum install -y \"ogp_agent.rpm\"\r\n</pre>\n<p>The second line installs the downloaded package named &#8220;ogp_agent.rpm&#8221; with &#8220;-y&#8221; which means already confirming all necessary packages included in it to be installed.</p>\n<p>Now the OGP has been installed. To connect OGP Agent with the panel, the panel will ask for an agent encryption key. After installing with the steps above, it will automatically generate an encryption key in your root directory. To get it, use the below-mentioned command.</p>\n<pre>sudo cat /root/ogp_enc_key\r\n</pre>\n<p>We&#8217;re done!</p>\n<hr />\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"A_VPS_to_Install_OGP_Agent_on!\"></span>A VPS to Install OGP Agent on!<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"></span></h2>\n<p>Planning to install your own OGP agent?

As a portable web application written primarily in PHP, it has become one of the most popular MySQL administration tools, especially for web hosting services.</p></blockquote>\n<p>So as mentioned above, it&#8217;s a database management interface which makes it easier for a developer to execute queries in a web-based GUI(Graphical User Interface). So before we begin, let&#8217;s take a look at how phpMyAdmin looks like.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_79\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-79\" style=\"width: 582px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-79\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/shadowhosting.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/phpmyadmin-user-interface.png?resize=582%2C301&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"582\" height=\"301\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/shadowhosting.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/phpmyadmin-user-interface.png?resize=300%2C155&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/shadowhosting.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/phpmyadmin-user-interface.png?w=745&amp;ssl=1 745w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 582px) 100vw, 582px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-79\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Credit:- DigitalOcean</figcaption></figure>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"How_To_Install_phpMyAdmin_on_CentOS_7_server\"></span>How To Install phpMyAdmin on CentOS 7 server?<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"></span></h2>\n<p>Starting on with step number one.</p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Step_1_%E2%80%93_Updating_Packages\"></span>Step 1 &#8211; Updating Packages<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"></span></h3>\n<p>Let&#8217;s update it via Yum package manager before we begin installing any type of packages.</p>\n<pre>sudo yum update -y</pre>\n<p>So with the above command, we&#8217;ve updated all packages currently existing in the server.

To do that, type the following command and press Enter.</p>\n<pre>service httpd restart</pre>\n<p>It&#8217;s time to test if your phpMyAdmin really works. To do so, copy your server&#8217;s hostname or IP address and paste it into a web browser with &#8220;/phpmyadmin&#8221; at the end. For example, http://1.2.3.4/phpmyadmin.

        "title": "How To Connect To Your VPS Using Putty? Connecting VPS",
        "content": "<p>Many people have difficulties connecting to their VPS after it is delivered to them. In this article, we&#8217;re going to learn how to simply download putty and connect to VPS using it. So let&#8217;s begin!</p>\n<h2>Connecting VPS using Putty</h2>\n<p>Before we begin, what actually &#8220;Putty&#8221; is? Putty is an open-source SSH client that is used as a command window to connect to Virtual Private Servers remotely. According to Wikipedia,</p>\n<blockquote>\n<div class=\"mod\" lang=\"en-IN\" data-md=\"50\" data-hveid=\"CAwQAA\" data-ved=\"2ahUKEwjdudK428PjAhVN7HMBHSs5AbcQkCkwHXoECAwQAA\">\n<div class=\"PZPZlf hb8SAc kno-fb-ctx\" data-attrid=\"description\" data-hveid=\"CAwQAQ\" data-ved=\"2ahUKEwjdudK428PjAhVN7HMBHSs5AbcQziAoADAdegQIDBAB\">\n<div class=\"r-ieQf9B0Fn60w\">\n<div class=\"kno-rdesc r-iaW71TXOSeH8\" data-rtid=\"iaW71TXOSeH8\">\n<div>PuTTY is a free and open-source terminal emulator, serial console and network file transfer application. It supports several network protocols, including SCP, SSH, Telnet, rlogin, and raw socket connection. It can also connect to a serial port. The name &#8220;PuTTY&#8221; has no official meaning.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Connecting VPS</h2>\n<p>So without wasting much time, we will first download the SSH client, Putty. To do that, head over to https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html and select you Windows with the bit. As soon as it is downloaded, you don&#8217;t have to install(if you downloaded the package).</p>\n<p>When you open, it will look like this.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-61\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/shadowhosting.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/putty.png?resize=519%2C507&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Connecting VPS by opening putty\" width=\"519\" height=\"507\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/shadowhosting.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/putty.png?resize=300%2C293&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/shadowhosting.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/putty.png?w=454&amp;ssl=1 454w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 519px) 100vw, 519px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<p>In the &#8220;Host Name(or IP address)&#8221;, enter your VPS IP and leave other settings as shown in the above screenshot(default). When you&#8217;re done, click on &#8220;Open&#8221; button in right downside. When you connect, you may see something like this.</p>\n<p><img class=\" wp-image-62 aligncenter\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/shadowhosting.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/puttyconnect.png?resize=534%2C440&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"534\" height=\"440\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/shadowhosting.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/puttyconnect.png?resize=300%2C247&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/shadowhosting.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/puttyconnect.png?w=398&amp;ssl=1 398w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 534px) 100vw, 534px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<p>Click on &#8220;Yes&#8221; to allow the host key to be registered into your system.

After entering the username as &#8220;root&#8221;, press enter. Now another line will come up, asking for a password. Enter the password. You might notice that the password is not being written, neither as asterisks. This is for security reason. Your password is being written but it will not show that you&#8217;re writing to avoid someone peeping into your screen and count the password length.

        "title": "Configuring Your CloudFlare Website To Avoid Getting It Bypass",
        "content": "<p><i>Short Introduction: Cloudflare is a Content Delivery Network(CDN) which builds up a wall between the website and the visitor. Due to miss config in CloudFlare settings, The Cloudflare wall can be bypassed. Today we&#8217;re gonna learn how to configure Cloudflare properly to avoid getting it bypassed.</i><br />\n<i><br />\n</i><b>What is Cloudflare? What does Cloudflare do with my website after I activate my website on Cloudflare?</b><br />\nCloudflare is a Content Delivery Network which builds up a wall between the website and the visitor. Only visitors are allowed to go through Cloudflare and even search engine crawlers are allowed but not attackers. Cloudflare covers the real IP address of the website with their IP address. Mostly CloudFlare IP(s) starts with 104.x.x.x. So a hacker bypasses it by brute-forcing the DNS of subdomains.</p>\n<p><b>How do CloudFlare works?</b></p>\n<div class=\"separator\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/3.bp.blogspot.com/-un3i9jC7_00/WRQG2niNQFI/AAAAAAAAALM/IDn_x5_mhd4TWBCzXK2d01d9VhgtXpEdQCPcB/s1600/cloudflare%2Bfunction.png?ssl=1\"><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/3.bp.blogspot.com/-un3i9jC7_00/WRQG2niNQFI/AAAAAAAAALM/IDn_x5_mhd4TWBCzXK2d01d9VhgtXpEdQCPcB/s400/cloudflare%2Bfunction.png?resize=400%2C200&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"bypass cloudflare\" width=\"400\" height=\"200\" border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"500\" data-original-width=\"1000\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></div>\n<p>The chart above explains how the attacker gets the access to the website when the website is not under Cloudflare protection and at the right side, you can see how does Cloudflare protects the website from the attacker.</p>\n<h2>How Does Hackers Bypass The Cloudflare&#8217;s Proxy?</h2>\n<p>When you register your domain to Cloudflare, they automatically fetch all the IP addresses on the DNS server. Once it is fetched, the user is asked to select what IPs are to be proxified(kept under Cloudflare DNS routing). As a default, Cloudflare marks the A record for &#8220;www&#8221; and root-domain as protected under Cloudflare DNS. But other subdomains are not marked, a user has to manually do it. Mostly newbies leave it as default and never puts it back to the orange-mark(mark it as Cloudflare DNS protected). The hacker in this scenario runs a subdomain brute force and pings every IP and checks for the ISP. If it is not Cloudflare&#8217;s IP, it is most likely to be origin IP. This is how it is bypassed.</p>\n<p><b>Setting up Cloudflare to avoid getting it bypassed.</b><br />\nCloudflare needs to be configured properly so that no one can bypass it. You may think that after adding your website to Cloudflare, you are protected. But you are wrong. Ever heard of that quote? &#8220;<b><i>With great powers, comes great responsibility</i></b>&#8220;. Yes, you need to configure its DNS. Now you are thinking, how to do that? Let&#8217;s start.</p>\n<p>Step one 1. Login to your Cloudflare account by going to the <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/a/login\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Cloudflare login portal.</a></p>\n<div class=\"separator\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/1.bp.blogspot.com/-tda9k1_Equo/WSkrgL2uRCI/AAAAAAAAAPQ/q0t9jMhiDFAHUpxFeL9WbuSefA-LN9kTACLcB/s1600/cf-login.PNG?ssl=1\"><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/1.bp.blogspot.com/-tda9k1_Equo/WSkrgL2uRCI/AAAAAAAAAPQ/q0t9jMhiDFAHUpxFeL9WbuSefA-LN9kTACLcB/s320/cf-login.PNG?resize=320%2C279&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"320\" height=\"279\" border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"405\" data-original-width=\"463\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></div>\n<div class=\"separator\"></div>\n<div class=\"separator\">Now as you know, you must be logged in to access the control panel of your website(Cloudflare control panel).</div>\n<div class=\"separator\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/3.bp.blogspot.com/-XDuHY6UJ2wo/WSkr-b15dZI/AAAAAAAAAPU/x9Od_DB5jng7LZ9hJ12VdiCaZLn5Z4LOQCLcB/s1600/cf-weblist.PNG?ssl=1\"><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/3.bp.blogspot.com/-XDuHY6UJ2wo/WSkr-b15dZI/AAAAAAAAAPU/x9Od_DB5jng7LZ9hJ12VdiCaZLn5Z4LOQCLcB/s400/cf-weblist.PNG?resize=400%2C163&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Selecting website to configure\" width=\"400\" height=\"163\" border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"453\" data-original-width=\"1100\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></div>\n<div class=\"separator\"></div>\n<div class=\"separator\">2. Now select the website you want to configure.</div>\n<div class=\"separator\">You may now come up with many options.</div>\n<div class=\"separator\"></div>\n<div class=\"separator\">Step 3. Go to DNS section</div>\n<div class=\"separator\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/1.bp.blogspot.com/-tGDXqpUgJeI/WSks--0jbuI/AAAAAAAAAPc/qa_4YaLOeKInJREDvb_C-WWuyVc4a0-ugCLcB/s1600/cf-dnssec.PNG?ssl=1\"><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/1.bp.blogspot.com/-tGDXqpUgJeI/WSks--0jbuI/AAAAAAAAAPc/qa_4YaLOeKInJREDvb_C-WWuyVc4a0-ugCLcB/s640/cf-dnssec.PNG?resize=640%2C96&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"640\" height=\"96\" border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"177\" data-original-width=\"1166\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></div>\n<div class=\"separator\"></div>\n<div class=\"separator\"></div>\n<p>Now you will see your subdomain which is protected. Go to your origin web hosting provider&#8217;s control panel and go to &#8220;DNS Settings&#8221; and check for all the sub names which are put up in the domain with their records. Example, cname.example.com. Record = CNAME. And now, as per the record, set it up with Cloudflare.</p>\n<h2>Putting The Protection Online &amp; Configuring It</h2>\n<p>And you&#8217;re all done! Make sure all the Orange tick are done. Check the screenshot below.<br />\nWhen the website is not under CloudFlare&#8217;s protection, it will look like this :</p>\n<div class=\"separator\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/2.bp.blogspot.com/-cFMWvPS2Pro/WSkuJWLSD9I/AAAAAAAAAPk/bf-6UIQtFt0bYwDhRi-RuHsEz6tXGUPCQCLcB/s1600/cf-withoutdns.PNG?ssl=1\"><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/2.bp.blogspot.com/-cFMWvPS2Pro/WSkuJWLSD9I/AAAAAAAAAPk/bf-6UIQtFt0bYwDhRi-RuHsEz6tXGUPCQCLcB/s400/cf-withoutdns.PNG?resize=400%2C205&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Marking Cloud on.\" width=\"400\" height=\"205\" border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"493\" data-original-width=\"961\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></div>\n<p>And when it is under Cloudflare DNS setting then it will be in orange like the below one.</p>\n<div class=\"separator\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/1.bp.blogspot.com/-b5wbE_XOeYY/WSkuRg49gcI/AAAAAAAAAPo/NpjRtek9RLkLyeWO2J2llzQJPIgZ2s5BQCLcB/s1600/cf-underdns.PNG?ssl=1\"><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/1.bp.blogspot.com/-b5wbE_XOeYY/WSkuRg49gcI/AAAAAAAAAPo/NpjRtek9RLkLyeWO2J2llzQJPIgZ2s5BQCLcB/s400/cf-underdns.PNG?resize=400%2C195&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"avoiding to get bypass\" width=\"400\" height=\"195\" border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"471\" data-original-width=\"961\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></div>\n<p>Now check for the upper screenshot. You will see how it looks when the website is under Cloudflare.<br />\nTo enable the DNS, check to click the grey cloud and when it turns to orange that means the website is under Cloudflare!</p>\n<p>Note:- If you put SMTP record(MX alias) under Cloudflare, then you won&#8217;t be able to send email from your Web app or cPanel. You need to get another email server which is totally different from the host.</p>\n<p>Now it will be a lot difficult for the hacker to bypass the Cloudflare protection and grab the origin IP.</p>\n<p>In the next article, we&#8217;ll learn how can one bypass Cloudflare protection step by step.</p>\n<p><i>(Hey!
